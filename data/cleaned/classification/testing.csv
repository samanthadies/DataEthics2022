suicide each year besides being directly debilitating to sufferer depression can adversely affect chronic health condition such a cardiovascular disease cancer diabetes and obesity it is also known to have negative influence on individual family and personal relationship work or school life and sleeping and eating habit over the coming year depression is projected to be the leading cause of disability in highincome nation such a the united state the world health organization who now rank major depression a one of the most burdensome disease in the world although a number of primary care program have been devised for it detection and treatment the majority of the million of american who meet depression criterion are untreated or undertreated furthermore ethnic minority group such a mexican american and african american are significantly le likely to receive depression therapy than are other ethnic group a part of a nationalscale effort to curb depression every few year the center for disease control and prevention cdc administers the behavioral risk factor surveillance system brfss survey via telephone to estimate the rate of depression among adult in the u however the large temporal gap across which these measurement are made a well a the limited number of participant response on the order of thousand make it difficult for agency to track and identify risk factor that may be associated with mental illness or to develop effective intervention program we examine the potential of social medium a a new tool for mental health measurement and surveillance platform such a twitter and facebook are increasingly gaining traction among individual allowing them to share their thought and emotion around a variety of happening in everyday life the emotion and language used in social medium posting may indicate feeling of worthlessness guilt helplessness and selfhatred that characterize depression a manifested in everyday life additionally depression sufferer often show withdrawal from social situation and activitiesie the etiology of depression typically includes social environmental factor characterization of social medium activity and changing social tie within social medium can provide measurement of such withdrawal and capture the depression sufferer social context in a manner that might help detect depression in population relying on social medium a a behavioral health assessment tool ha other advantage a well for instance in contrast to the selfreport methodology in behavioral survey where response are prompted by the experimenter and typically comprise recollection of sometimes subjective health fact social medium measurement of behavior capture social activity and language expression in a naturalistic setting such activity is realtime and happens in the course of a person daytoday life hence it is le vulnerable to memory bias or experimenter demand effect and can help track concern at a finegrained temporal scale our main contribution in this paper are a follows using crowdsourcing technique we gather a ground truth set of k twitter posting shared by individual suffering from clinical depressiondepression wa measured using the cesd center for epidemiologic study depression scale screening test we develop statistical model an svm classifier that can predict whether or not a twitter post in a test set could be depressionindicative to construct and test the predictive model we harness evidence from a variety of measure spanning emotional expression linguistic style user engagement and egocentric social network property we demonstrate that our model can predict if a post is depressionindicative with accuracy of more than and precision of finally we propose a metric we refer to a the social medium depression index smdi smdi us the above prediction model to determine depressiveindicative posting on twitter and thereby help characterize the level of depression in population we conduct a variety of analysis at population scale examining depression level a given by smdi across geography u city and state demographic gender and time including diurnal and seasonal pattern our finding from these analysis align with cdc reported statistic of depression in u population a well a confirm known characteristic of depression given in clinical literature we believe that when tied to behavioral health

bear information on whether or not they could contain depressionbearingindicative content we tackle this issue by collecting actual depression information on a set of twitter user the idea is that the posting made by a user suffering from depression will contain cue or signal that could reflect their mental condition such posting would thus help construct the positivetarget class ie set of post that are depressionindicative necessary for classification identifying clinically depressed user we employ a crowdsourcing methodology to collect information on the status of depression of a set of user using amazon mechanical turk interface we designed hit wherein crowdworkers were asked to take a clinical depression survey followed by selfreport seeking question on their depression history the crowdworkers could also optin to share their twitter usernames if they had a public profile we sought response from crowdworkers who were located in the u and had an approval rating greater than or equal to each crowdworker wa restricted to take the hit exactly once and wa paid cent for completing the task we used the cesd center for epidemiologic study depression scale questionnaire a the primary tool to determine the depression level in the crowdworkers the cesd is a item selfreport scale designed to measure depressive symptom in the general population higher score in the test indicate the presence of more symptomatology in our study we also collected information about the crowdworkers depression history through the following question whether or not they have been diagnosed with clinical depression in the past if so when if the answer above wa positive what wa the estimated date of onset of depression from the date of depression onset how many depression episode had they experienced finally we asked the crowdworkers to share their public twitter username for research purpose under the privacy clause that their data may be mined using a computer program and analyzed anonymously statistic of crowdsourcing study a total of crowdworkers completed our hit between september and october however not all crowdworkers opted in to share their twitter usernames participant agreed to provide u access to their twitter feed next we eliminated noisy respondent who took too little time to complete the task finally we sought data from individual with depression onset date anytime in the last one year but no later than three month before the survey wa taken these constraint were assumed to ensure that for each user detected with depression we would have sufficient posting on twitter after the onset and until the point in time that they took the survey we also sought user who had reported to be clinically depressed and were currently so a well based on the scoring on the survey with at least two depression episode in the studied period this helped u to focus on high precision data for which we had recurring sign of depression depression would be a prevalent condition in these individual a set of user wa obtained who indicated either they have clinical depression with onset in or after september and before june or did not have depression anytime the set contained male female and the median age wa year a distribution of the user per their depression score is displayed in figure based on the standard cutoff of or above for highrange depression we found user with sign of severe depression separately we obtained a set of user with score in the range who showed very little likelihoodalmost no sign of depression in the period of our interest building ground truth dataset we now discus how we constructed a dataset of twitter post with groundtruth label information on whether or not the post is depressionindicative we use twitter posting of the two set of user obtained above for the positive class depressionindicative post and for the negative class standard post for each user in both set we use all of their posting in a threemonth period for the positive class of post we collect all posting made by user in the first set during the three month after their indicated onset of depression for the negative class we collect all posting made by user in the second set during the three month before the date they took our survey for collecting the post we utilized the firehose made available to u via our organization contract with twitter table give the final statistic of the dataset thus constructed a few example of post from the target class of depression indicative post are given in

https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2464464.2464480,1,9,"De Choudhury, Counts, Horvits",3,1,0,0,2013,we now utilize smdi to understand a variety of population characteristic of depression geographical analysis we present analysis on how our social medium depression index reflects the known depression rate in several u city and state first we collected a list of city reported by businessweekcom to be the unhappiest u city the list includes a percity depression rank a measured by prescription drug claim for common antidepressant these statistic were reported at end of using twitter firehose we crawled random sample of twitter post english language per month between jan and dec for each city to approximately match the time period around which these number were reported note that matching a post with a city wa made based on the post author selfreport location on the twitter profile although other sophisticated location inference scheme may be adopted in future work table give statistic of the data crawled for each city we used our trained prediction model to label all the post shared every day from each city on whether they were depressionindicative and thereafter computed the corresponding smdi per day eqn we further calculated a mean smdi per city throughout the time of analysis figure show the social medium depression index of all the city yaxis against their reported ranking in term of depression rate xaxis the main observation in the figure is that we observe reasonable correlation r between our computed smdi and known depression rate in the various city note that the slope of the trend line in the figure is positive this is because we are predicting depression rank for which lower rank implies worse condition on examination of the trend it appears that we may be overestimating the degree of depression in more city eg portland cleveland louisville atlanta kansa city than the number of city for which we underestimating the degree of depression eg new orleans detroit to the extent this is true this may be an artifact of a general tendency for people to express relatively more negativity on twitter prior literature show that negative affect is more predominantly expressed on twitter than is positive affect thus our model may be misinterpreting some expression of negativity a depressionindicative next we expand our geographical analysis to understand how smdi reflects actual depression rate in the u state in this case we obtain data on depression rate in the various state from the center for disease control and prevention cdc per the behavioral risk surveillance survey brfss conducted in for computing smdi we follow a similar approach a done with the city that is we compile a set of twitter post for each state based on regex matching of the state name with the user selfreported location on twitter our twitter data go back to june and thus to best align with the cdc data we collected a sample of twitter data over a six month period between jun and dec there were a total of approximately m post over all the state in our sample thus compiled figure show heat map rendering of actual and predicted depression rate in various stateshigher intensity color imply greater depression rate reported by cdc top or greater smdi bottom using the exact percent of each state population that is depressed a opposed to the binned value in figure the pearson correlation between actual perstate rate of depression and those predicted by smdi is found to be this demonstrates that our metric can capture to a reasonable extent the actual rate of depression known in these state demographic analysis gender difference in this section we perform a demographiccentric analysis of depression comparing men and woman our goal is to be able to examine whether the rate of depression a found by the brfss survey same source a above for men and woman align with the smdi rate for the purpose we utilize the same corpus of twitter post used in the analysis reported in figure this analysis however necessitated that we know the gender of the author of a post which is not an available attribute from twitter hence we utilized a gender classifier that us regex matching of twitter selfreported first name of user with a gazetteer of name and gender collated from u census baby name list and public facebook profile a found in a gender classifier of this type is known to yield accuracy between in our corpus we obtained about woman and the rest men after about coverage over all user for each post for which the author gender wa inferred we computed the individualcentric measure of smdi see eqn figure show the result we observe that we can reasonably predict the percentage of men and woman depressed woman are known to suffer from time more depression than men approximately that ratio is observed in our prediction a well time in our case a given by the actual rate of percent depressed in figure this is denoted by the nearly parallel line for predicted and actual percent of each gender who are depressed however a with our previous analysis on geography we observe a slight overestimation of depression when using our method interestingly it appears that overestimation is higher for woman than for men notice the smdi value specifically one possibility is that woman generally show greater emotional expressivity than men typically negative in affect hence leading to a bias in our model temporal analysis in this final section on populationscale analysis we focus on understanding some of the temporal pattern of depression at diurnal and annual scale we first use the same data a used in figure to study level of smdi over the course of a typical day in local time across men and woman this is shown in figure a in correspondence with our finding in figure we see that diurnal smdi value for woman are higher than that of men p although they have high correlation r an interesting finding of this study is that for both men and woman smdi is higher during the night than during the day with smdi value peaking at around midnight and the lowest value appearing around noon a mentioned before psychiatric literature on depression indicates that out of people suffering from depression exhibit worsened symptom at night people become more prone to worrying thought at night due to loneliness break from work lack of energy or other interaction between lightdarkness and the nervous system next we study the rhythm of smdi over the course of a year aggregated in pitstops of month for this purpose we expand the above dataset and derive two sample of twitter post ranging between jun may and jan dec m post in all the yearly pattern of smdi for several u city chosen for exemplary purpose with high depression rate see figure for detail are shown in figure averaged across the two dataset snapshot we also show an average trend for all post combining all location denoted a all we observe that the yearly depression pattern show a seasonal trend with highest depression observed during winter season in the u decjan while the lowest during summer junaug and to some extent fall sepnov clinical literature indicates that there is greater prevalence of depressive anxiety during winter at northern latitude sometimes attributed to insufficient exposure to light during winter across the city we observe that smdi in certain city is more associated with weather condition than others jacksonville and seattle are both ranked high in term of depression rate however the variation in smdi trend for seattle is much higher than that for jacksonville in fact the percent difference between seattle and jacksonville smdi during winter is higher than that during summer note that seattle seasonal weather variation are more extreme than those for jacksonville per national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa a also supported by clinical literature we thus conjecture that twitter user based in seattle are more prone to depressive symptom during winter than in jacksonville or other low weather variability city however notice that even during the summer city like jacksonville and other low weather variation city eg nashville show considerable depression prevalence smdi for jacksonville in summer is which is higher compared to some of the other city that is it appears that while weather may have a strong role to play in the depression rate there are likely to be other factor at play for instance socioeconomic status unemployment rate which may explain the higher smdi in

how they communicate what activity they engage in and how they interact with the world around them including friend and family additionally capturing population level behavioral trend from web data ha

interface api specifically this doe not include any data that ha been marked a private by the author or any direct message diagnosed group we seek user who publicly state that they have been diagnosed with various mental illness user may make such a statement to seek support from others in their social network to fight the taboo of mental illness or perhaps a an explanation of some of their behavior tweet were obtained using regular expression on a large multiyear health related collection eg i wa diagnosed with x we searched for four condition depression bipolar disorder post traumatic stress disorder ptsd and seasonal affective disorder sad the matched diagnosis tweet were manually labeled a to whether the tweet contained a genuine statement of a mental health diagnosis table show example of both genuine statement of diagnosis and disingenuous statement often joke or quote next we retrieved the most recent tweet up to for each user with a genuine diagnosis tweet we then filtered the user to remove those with fewer than tweet and those whose tweet were not at least in english measured using the compact language detector these filtering step left u with user that were considered positive example table indicates the number of user and tweet found for each of the mental health category examined we manually examined and annotated only half the diagnosis statement for depression indicating there are likely depression user available via these automatic method from our collection compared to the obtained via the method of de choudhury et al d additionally we emphasize the low cost and effort of our automated effort a compared to their crowdsourced survey method the difference in collection method also suggests that the two have a reasonable chance of being complementary this is especially significant when considering disorder with lower incidence rate than depression arguably the highest where respondent to crowdsourced survey or selfstated diagnosis alike are rare this method is similar in spirit to that of de choudhury et al c where they inferred a tweetlevel classifier for depression from userlevel label specifically tweet from the past three month from user scoring highly on cesd for the positive class and conversely for the negative control group to build model for analysis and to validate the data we also need a sample of the general population to use a an approximation of community control we follow a similar process randomly select k usernames from a list of twitter user who posted to a separate random historical collection within a selected two week window downloaded the most recent tweet from these user and apply our two filter at least tweet and english this yield a control group of random user whose million tweet were used a negative example caveat our method for finding user with mental health diagnosis ha significant caveat the method may only capture a subpopulation of each disorder ie those who are speaking publicly about what is usually a very private matter which may not truly represent all aspect of the population a a whole this method in no way verifies whether this diagnosis is genuine ie people are not always truthful in selfreports however given the stigma often associated with mental illness it seems unlikely user would tweet that they are diagnosed with a condition they do not have the control group is likely contaminated by the presence of user that are diagnosed with the various condition investigated we make no attempt to remove these user and if we assume that

quantifiable mental health signal in twitter first we validate our method for obtaining data by replicating previous finding using liwc next we build classifier to distinguish each group from the control group demonstrating that there is useful signal in the language of each group and compare these classifier finally we analyze the correlation between our analytics and classifier to uncover relationship between them and derive insight into quantifiable and relevant mental health signal in twitter validation first we provide some validation for our novel method for gathering sample we demonstrate that language use a measured by liwc is statistically significantly different between control and diagnosed user figure show the proportion of tweet from each user that score positively on various liwc category ie have at least one word from that category boxandwhiskers plot tukey summarize a distribution of observation and ease comparison between them here each observation is the proportion of a user tweet that score positively on liwc the median of the distribution is the black horizontal line in the middle of the bar the bar cover the inter quartile range where of the observation lie the whisker are a robust estimate of the extent of the data with outlier plotted a circle beyond the whisker an approximation of statistical significance is indicated by the pinched in notch on each bar if the notch on the bar do not overlap the difference between those distribution is different confidence interval each bar is colored according to diagnosis and each group of bar note the score for one liwc category difference that reach statistical significance from the control group are noted with asterisk eg pro swear anger negemo and anxiety are statistically significantly different for the depression group importantly this replicates previous finding of significant difference between depressed user according to an internetadministered diagnostic battery significant increase are expected in negemo anger pro and pro and no change in posemo given all previous work park et al chung and pennebaker de choudhury et al d we replicate all these finding except the increase in pro which only de choudhury et al d found which validates our data collection method classification we next explore the ability of the various analytics to separate diagnosed from control user and ass performance on a leaveoneout crossvalidation task we train a log linear classifier on the feature described in using scikitlearn pedregosa et al the receiver operating characteristic roc curve in figure and demonstrate performance of the various classifier at the task of separating diagnosed from control group in all case the correct detection or hit are on the yaxis and the false detection or false alarm are on the xaxis figure compare performance across diagnosis one line per disorder figure show one plot per mental health condition with the performance of the various analytics individually and in concert a individual roc curve a few trend emerge all analytics show some ability to separate the class indicating they are finding useful signal the lm provide superior performance to the other analytics indicating there are more signal present in the language than are captured by liwc and patternoflife analytics for readability we do not show the performance of all combination of analytics but they perform a expected any set of them perform equal to or better than their individual component taken together this indicates that there is information relevant to separating diagnosed user from control in all the analytics discussed here furthermore this highlight that there remains significant signal to be uncovered and understood in the language of social medium these trend also allow u to compare the disorder a manifest in language usage though this tends to raise more question than it answer generally the patternoflife analytics and liwc are on par but this is decidedly not true for depression where patternoflife seems to perform especially poorly and for sad where patternoflife seems to perform especially well this indicates that the depression user have patternsoflife that look more similar to the control than is the case for the other disorder perhaps especially surprising given the inclusion of the sentiment lexicon and that there may be

each year including depression eating disorder like anorexia and bulimia bipolar disorder and post traumatic stress disorder ptsd ptsd and other mental illness are difficult to diagnose with competing standard for diagnosis based on selfreports and testimony from friend and relative in recent year several study have turned to social medium data to study mental health since it provides an unbiased collection of a person language and behavior which ha been shown to be useful in diagnosing condition de choudhury additionally from a public health standpoint social medium data and web data in general have enabled large scale analysis of a population health status beyond what ha previously been possible with traditional method ayers et al while social medium provides ample data for many type of public health analysis paul and dredze mental health study still face serious challenge first other health work in social medium such a disease surveillance brownstein freifeld and madoff chew and eysenbach lamb paul and dredze and modeling sadilek kautz and silenzio rely on explicit mention of illness or health issue if people are sick they say so in contrast mental health condition largely display implicit change in language and behavior such a a switch in the type of topic a shift in word usage or a shift in frequency of post while de choudhury et al find some example of explicit depression mention the focus is on more subtle change in language eg pronoun use second obtaining labeled data for a mental health condition is challenging since we are examining implicit feature of language de choudhury et al rely on crowdsourced volunteer to take depression survey and offer their twitter feed for research while this yield reliable data it is timeconsuming and challenging to build large data set for a diverse set of mental health condition furthermore the necessary mental health evaluation such a the dsm diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder are difficult to perform a these evaluation require a trained diagnostician and have been criticized a unscientific and subjective insel thus relying on data from crowdsourced volunteer to build datasets of user with diverse mental health condition is difficult and perhaps untenable we provide an alternate method for gathering sample that partially ameliorate these problem ideally to be used in concert with existing method in this paper we study ptsd in twitter data one of the first study to consider social medium for a mental health condition beyond depression de choudhury count and horvitz de choudhury et al rosenquist fowler and christakis rather than rely on traditional ptsd diagnostic tool foa for finding data we demonstrate that some ptsd user can be easily and automatically identified by scanning for tweet expressing explicit diagnosis while it is natural to be suspicious of selfidentified reporting we find that selfidentifying ptsd user have demonstrably different language usage pattern from the random user according to the linguistic inquiry word count liwc a psychometrically validated analysis tool pennebaker chung and ireland we demonstrate elsewhere coppersmith dredze and harman submitted that data obtained in this way replicates analysis performed via liwc on the crowdsourced survey respondent of de choudhury et al we also demonstrate that user who selfidentify are measurably different from random user by learning a classifier to discriminate between selfidentified and random user we further show how this data can be used to train a classifier that detects elevated incidence of ptsd in tweet from u military base a compared to the general u population with a further increase around base that deployed combat troop overseas we

facebook languagebased prediction model perform similarly to screening survey in identifying patient with depression when using diagnostic code in the emr to identify diagnosis of depression the profile of depressionassociated language marker is nuanced covering emotional sadness depressed mood interpersonal hostility loneliness and cognitive selffocus rumination process which previous research ha established a congruent with the determinant and consequence of depression the growth of social medium and continuous improvement of machinelearning algorithm suggest that social mediabased screening method for depression may become increasingly feasible and more accurate we chose to examine depression because it is prevalent disabling underdiagnosed and treatable a a major driver of medical morbidity and mortality it is important to more thoroughly diagnose and treat depression across the population patient with depression exhibit poorer medical outcome after acute inpatient care increased utilization of emergency care resource and increased allcause mortality identifying patient at an earlier stage in their mental illness through novel mean of detection creates opportunity for patient to be connected more readily with appropriate care resource the present analysis suggests that social mediabased prediction of future depression status may be possible a early a mo before the first documentation of depression in the medical record in the primary care setting a diagnosis of depression is often missed the reason for such underdetection is multifactorial depression ha a broad array of possible presenting symptom and it severity change across time primary care provider are also tasked with addressing many facet of health within a clinical visit that may be a brief a min previous research ha recommended improving detection of depression through the routine use of multistep assessment process initial identification of individual who may be developing depression via analysis of social medium may serve a the first step in such a process using a detection threshold favoring high true positive rate with the increasing integration of social medium platform smartphones and other technology into the life of patient novel avenue are becoming available to detect depression unobtrusively these method include the algorithmic analysis of phone sensor usage and gps position data on smartphones and of facial expression in image and video such a those shared on social medium platform in principle these different screening modality could be combined in a way that improves overall screening to identify individual to complete selfreport inventory or be assessed by a clinician in the present study patient permitted researcher to collect several year of retroactive social medium data these longitudinal data may allow clinician to capture the evolution of depression severity over time with a richness unavailable to traditional clinical survey delivered at discrete time point the language exhibited by patient who ultimately developed depression wa nuanced and varied covering a wide array of depressionrelated symptom change in language pattern about specific symptom could alert clinician to specific depression symptom among their consenting patient this study illustrates how social mediabased detection technology may optimize diagnosis within one facet of health these technology raise important question related to patient privacy informed consent data protection and data ownership clear guideline are needed about access to these data reflecting the sensitivity of content the people accessing it and their purpose developer and policymakers need to address the challenge that the application of an algorithm may change social medium post into protected health information with the corresponding expectation of privacy and the right of patient to remain autonomous in their health care decision similarly those who interpret the data need to recognize that people may change what they write based on their perception of how that information might be observed and used the key contribution of this study is that it link mental health diagnosis with social medium content and that it used this linkage to reveal association between the content and symptom of a prevalent underdiagnosed and treatable condition this suggests that one day the analysis of social medium language could serve a a scalable frontline tool for the identification of depressed individual together with the growing sophistication

will die from those attempt suicide death have increased by in the past year making suicide one of the top cause of death in the united state a pattern that seems to be constant across geographic region within the country not only is the magnitude of the problem large and worsening there ha been little progress made over the past year in understanding suicide and improving outcome in atrisk individual the stubbornness of the problem reflects it complexity and the densely interwoven causal factor underlying it here we focus on one piece of the puzzle how can we identify those who are at risk of taking or attempting to take their own life and how can this screening be used to foster effective intervention assessing an individual risk for suicidal behavior is difficult experienced and talented clinician frequently struggle to correctly interpret signal in their patient behavior that are indicative of suicide risk setting aside the profound difficulty associated with understanding an individual personal history and it relationship to their capacity and motivation for selfharm there are at least practical reason that assessing suicide risk is difficult the latency between the onset of acute risk for suicide and the suicide attempt itself may be too small for intervention requiring contact with health professional and most existing method for detecting high risk of suicide require that individual disclose their wish to harm themselves to a health professional in this article we explore the possibility that digital life datathat is the interaction that a person ha with digital device through the daily course of their life collected passively but with consent might at least partially address each of these difficulty individual come to be at risk for suicide at different temporal interval relative to suicide attempt for instance the kind of social isolation that is frequently associated with suicide can gradually accumulate over the course of a person life or may become acute in a very short period of time after a traumatic life event such a the loss of a loved one moreover once an individual is engaged with a health care professional standard method of suicide intervention require both that the clinician administer a standardized risk assessment often in the form of a questionnaire and that the patient disclose their intention to harm themselves each of these present it own challenge first administering a suicide screening tool may place an unreasonable burden on the health care provider the standard for suicide screening within the health care system is beck scale for suicide ideation a or item questionnaire examining the patient active and passive desire for suicide and any specific plan they might have many patient who are at risk for suicide only interact with primary care physician pcp or emergency department ed rather than those with psychiatric specialty such health care provider may lack the time or the training to administer a specific questionnaire for suicide risk indeed enabling pcp and ed to better screen for suicide risk ha been posited a a method for reducing the suicide rate second patient cannot always be relied upon to disclose suicidal thought in the clinical setting these factor have the potential for a large impact if missed screening opportunity can be capitalized upon of patient attempting suicide visited a mental health professional in the week period prior to their attempt with having visited a health professional of any kind in the same period of time independent of the efficacy and specificity of these scale and instrument for screening for suicide risk they are pragmatically limited in their application to time when a patient is interacting with the health care system the health care professional they are interacting with deems administration of a suicide risk screening a worthy use of time and the patient is willing to disclose suicidal thought plan or action at that time many at risk are not engaged with the health care system at all there are strong correlation of statebased suicide rate with indicator for lack of access to health care ahmedani et al report that of individual attempting suicide had not seen a mental health care practitioner in the prior year and had not seen any health care practitioner in the prior year with significant variation among racial and ethnic group furthermore the health care system seems to have a significant and systematic gap for helping individual after their suicide attempt substance abuse and mental health service administration samhsa survey data from showed that of drugrelated suicide attempt ed admission showed no evidence of followup treatment taken together the existing infrastructure for suicide risk detection and intervention highlight the need for some way of screening individual outside the context of their interaction with the health care system and for detecting signal positively associated with suicidal behavior that are le overt than explicit disclosure the above suggests at least path to improve screening for suicide risk within the existing health care system providing evidence of risk without relying exclusively on self disclosure and the pragmatic reduction of time needed with a health care worker to administer the screening tool and thus reducing the resistance to administering the tool on the part of the health care professional furthermore a model capable of identifying those at risk outside the health care system could be part of a system to funnel them toward appropriate care interestingly there ha been significant progress in using data outside the health care system to ass and understand mental health and wellbeing in recent year which some refer to a digital phenotyping eg onnela and rauch in particular signal related to a person mental health and wellbeing have been extracted from a person digital life digital life generally cover all the interaction that a person ha with digital device through the daily course of their life including social medium data eg facebook instagram twitter reddit data from wearable device eg fitbit jawbone geolocation actigriphy from phone sensor or interaction with smart device eg amazon alexa or other internet of thing iot device for one point of comparison see figure which show one person interaction with the health care system in red hash and post on facebook in blue hash over the course of a few year a growing body of work suggests that various fact about an individual mental health can be inferred from the text that a person generates raising the intriguing possibility that social medium data could be used a a screening andor early detection tool social medium data have been found to contain predictive signal for condition including major depressive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder schizophrenia eating disorder generalized anxiety disorder bipolar disorder selfharm suicide borderline personality disorder and others computational analysis of social medium data may therefore fulfill the desideratum of a screening system that capture an individual behavior outside of their interaction with the health care system and is amenable to the kind of automation and scalability that is often sorely lacking in underfunded and resourceconstrained health care provider this article primary contribution are a follows the creation of an automated model for analysis and estimation of suicide risk from social medium data an examination of how this could be used to improve existing

condition however detecting the risk of suicide a well a monitoring the effect of related mental health condition is challenging traditional method rely on both selfreports and impression formed during short session with a clinical expert but it is often unclear when suicide is a risk in particular consequently condition leading to preventable suicide are often not adequately addressed automated monitoring and risk assessment of patient language ha the potential to complement traditional assessment method providing objective measurement to motivate further care and additional support for people with difficulty related to mental health this pave the way towards verifying the need for additional care with insurance coverage for example a well a offering direct benefit to clinician and patient we explore some of the possibility in the deep learning and mental health space using written social medium text that people with different mental health condition are already producing uncovering method that work with such text provides the opportunity to help people with different mental health condition by leveraging a task they are already participating in social medium

caruana sutton et al rush et al collobert et al sgaard and goldberg suicide risk and related mental health condition are therefore good candidate for modeling in a multitask framework in this paper we propose multitask learning for detecting suicide risk and mental health condition the task of our model include neuroatypicality ie atypical mental health and suicide attempt a well a the related mental health condition of anxiety depression eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia bipolar disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd and we explore the effect of task selection on model performance we additionally include the effect of modeling gender which ha been shown to improve accuracy in task using social medium text volkova et al hovy predicting suicide risk and several mental health condition jointly open the possibility for the model to leverage a shared representation for condition that frequently occur together a phenomenon known a comorbidity further including gender reflects the fact that gender difference are found in the pattern of mental health who which may help to sharpen the model the mtl framework we propose allows such shared information across prediction and enables the inclusion of several loss function with a common shared underlying representation this approach is flexible enough to extend to factor other than the one shown here provided suitable data we find that choosing task that are prerequisite or related to the main task is critical for learning a strong model similar to caruana we further find that modeling gender improves accuracy across a variety of condition including suicide risk the bestperforming model from our experiment demonstrates that multitask learning is a promising new direction in automated assessment of mental

and concern have been raised about how medium communication may have an influence on suicidal ideation and cause a contagion effect between vulnerable subject with the advent of open and massively popular social networking and microblogging web site such a facebook tumblr and twitter frequently referred to a social medium attention ha focussed on how these new mode of communication may become a new highly interconnected forum for collective communication and like news medium reporting lead to contagion of suicidal ideation social science and medical research have investigated the impact that communication on the topic of suicide via the world wide web may have on vulnerable subject with particular attention to the younger generation conducted a qualitative study by interviewing young adult who engage in suicidal behaviour and use website dedicated to these theme also conducted online search for web resource containing suiciderelated term and describing suicide method they presented a qualitative analysis of the resource they discovered and concluded that although neutral and antisuicide web site occurred most frequently prosuicide forum and web site encouraging suicidal behaviour were also present and available suggesting that more prevention plan specifically focused on web resource are required building on this have reviewed online suicide intervention and prevention literature concluding that there is a lack of published evidence about online prevention strategy and more attention is required to develop and evaluate online preventative approach also studied the impact of facebook suicide note on suicidal behaviour reporting that it wa not yet clear to what extent suicide note on online social medium actually induce copycat suicide they note that suicide and social medium effect deserve further evaluation and research other study have focused on the written communication of suicide on the web via bulletin board newsgroups chat room and web forum these are mostly qualitative analysis and where quantitative data are used in webrelated suicide study they tend to rely solely on human classification which is difficult to implement at scale computational method have only been used in a small number of suicide communication study some study report a positive correlation between suicide rate and the volume of social medium post that may be related to suicidal ideation and intent there is also a developing body of literature on the topic of identifying suicidal language on twitter but very few attempt to use machine classification to automatically identify suicidal language and differentiate between this and other form of suiciderelated communication such a awareness raising and reporting of suicide the differentiation is a requirement for the purpose of analysing the characteristic of suicidal ideation on social medium study depression and other emotional state expressed via social medium suicidal language is likely to include emotive content and possible sign of depression but we do not suggest depression and suicidal ideation are synonymous in this paper two very recent paper presented the result of twitter study aiming to classify risky language and level of distress both reporting classification performance that ha potential for improvement around an important step in providing support to suicidal social medium user is to understand how suicidal ideation is communicated recent study have shown that people are more likely to seek support from nonprofessional resource such a social medium rather than risk social stigmatisation by seeking formal treatment thus our study aim to contribute to the literature on understanding communication on the topic of suicide in social medium by i creating a new humanannotated dataset to help identify feature of suicidal ideation ii creating a set of benchmark experimental result for machine learning approach to the classification of suicidal ideation and iii developing a machine classifier capable of distinguishing between worrying language such a suicidal ideation and flippant reference to suicide awareness raising about suicide and report of suicide this last contribution is especially relevant to quantify actual volume of worrying language on social medium for the purpose of understanding risk to human safety a opposed to all reference to suicide the research presented in this paper comprises an analysis of data collected from the microblogging website twitter the text of which ha been classified into one of seven suicidereleated

project will study a group of u war veteran who will optin to share their twitter facebook and linkedin post over time there are so far no publicly available result from this study but the group ha recently published the result of a suicide prediction task using text from the clinical note of u war veteran to identify textbased statistically significant signal of suicidality with around accuracy they found clinical note of people who had died through suicide frequently recorded behaviour indicative of fear agitiation and delusion written text ha also been analysed in a number of recent study that have analysed suicide note and developed machine classifier to identify topic and emotion expressed by people who have taken their life many of these paper attempt to classify text at a sentence level which would suggest short string much like those that would be posted to social medium however suicide note are written by people who have accepted suicide and then go on to harm themselves whereas the current research is particularly interested in identifying suicidal thinking or ideation prior to selfharm which may differ from the language used in suicide note additionally handwritten note even at sentence level are not constrained by string length twitter post are limited to character which force author to use short informal language that may differ from the way they would normally express feeling on paper finally social medium data are noisy contain a broad range of topic and language use varies over time these feature arguably make the task of classifying suicidal ideation more complex than it would be in a discrete recording of presuicide thought and feeling in a suicide note a small number of study have investigated the communication of suicidal ideation on social medium however they are mainly focused on a comparison with national death rate for example in korea and the u research ha attempted to identify a positive correlation between the frequency of suiciderelated post on social medium and the number of recorded suicide case suicide related post were identified using a set of keywords relating to general concept such a suicide and depression or relating to suicide method analysed the twitter post of a person who had recently died through suicide they studied the post sent in the twentyfour hour prior to death finding an increase in positive emotion though not statistically significant and a change in focus from the self to others a the time of death approached a this wa only a single person study and given the fact the person had attempted to make the post rhyme thereby perhaps using different language to achieve this the author propose larger study of a wider range of twitter post they used the linguistic inquiry and word count liwc software to identify part of speech emotional word and cognitive process among other concept liwc wa also used in a a sampling technique to identify sad twitter post that were subsequently classified using a machine learning into level of distress on an ordinal scale with around accuracy in the bestcase also studying linguistic feature of suicidal ideation used an online panel of young early s twitter user to examine the association between suiciderelated tweet and suicidal behaviour they identified that particular phrase such a want to commit suicide were strongly associated with lifetime suicide attempt the most powerful predictor of future suicide they also noted that other phrase that suggest suicidal intent such a want to die were le strongly associated the variation here could suggest the flippant use of such phrase on social medium when having a bad day hence the additional challenge posed to classification of suicidal ideation on social medium finally used machine learning to classify risky and non risky tweet a defined by human annotator with an accuracy of around they created word list to represent a number of topic and emotion related to suicide finding

https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2700171.2791023,9,4,"Burnap, Colombo, Scourfield",3,0,0,0,2015,rather than manually developing a word list to represent suicidal language we generated a lexicon of term by collecting anonymised data from known suicide web forum blog and microblogs and asking human annotator to identify whether it contained reference to suicidal ideation first we collected user post from four known web site identified by expert in the field a being used to discus suicidal theme for support and prevention the selected web site either had dedicated section or are specifically designed for suicidal discussion then we collected data from microblogging site tumblr specifically content containing selfclassified suicidal ideation ie text post tagged with the word suicide for each of the resulting web site we then collected an equal number of post retrieved in chronological order with a total of text post these post and post randomly selected from the tubmlr sample were subsequently human annotated using the crowdsourcing online service crowdflower to avoid difficulty in the annotation of long piece of text we discarded post having a length greater than the five percent longer than the average post length for each of the website considered human annotator were asked to identify content containing suicidal ideation using a binary criterion by answering the question is this person suicidal we then applied the term frequencyinverse document frequency tfidf method to the corpus of annotated document in order to identify term that appear frequently in the suicidal ideation class but appear with le frequency in the nonideation class this process identifies term that can be used to distinguish between the two class in the tfidf process we considered ngrams of to word in length and ranked the top term these term were further analysed by two experienced suicide researcher to remove term not specifically related to suicide a well a duplicate keywords this resulted in a final list of keywords and phrase that suggested possible suicide intent illustrative example are asleep and never wake dont want to exist and kill myself these search term were then used to collect data from twitter via the twitter streaming application programming interface api twitter data were collected for a continuous period of six week from st february using the suiciderelated search term resulting in a dataset of over four million post in parallel we monitored traditional medium over the same period to identify the name of reported suicide case in england we then retrieved a second data set from twitter using the name and surname of the deceased a search keywords here the underlying idea wa to collect different type of post with a connection to suicide other than those more directly expressing suicidal ideation which wa the aim of the first dataset collection all name were removed from the text before analysis following the data collection we produced a random sample of tweet from both datasets with of post from the collection of suicide related search term and the remaining from the name dataset the human annotation task wa repeated using the same crowdsourcing service this time human annotator were asked to classify data into either one or more of the six suicide related category listed below or into the seventh category representing tweet that cannot be classified into any of them this coding frame wa developed with expert researcher in suicide study to capture the best representation of how people generally communicate on the topic of suicide text annotation can be a subjective task so to limit the amount of subjectivity we required at least human annotation per tweet a per the convention in related research crowdflower provides an agreement score for each annotated unit which is based on the majority vote of the trusted worker because the crowdsourcing service continues to recruit worker until the task is complete there is no guarantee that all worker will annotate the same set of unit therefore we cannot calculate traditional interrater reliability irr score such a krippendorfs alpha or cohens kappa to determine agreement between all annotator however crowdflower ha been shown to produce an agreement score that compare well to these classic measure based on the output from our annotator task we can determine agreement on each unit the purpose of the experiment performed in this paper are to establish the accuracy of a machine classifier when assigning tweet to a particular class of suicidal communication and thus it is the agreement score for the unit of analysis each tweet and not the overall human agreement for all unit that is important for validation we removed all tweet with le than agreement again following established method from related research and discarded any where le than three out of four annotator agreed on the dominant class for each tweet annotator were allowed to select multiple class label and the majority choice wa taken the distribution of tweet to class from cc is shown in table note that the dominant class wa flippant and improper use of suiciderelated phrase and expression with actual suicidal intent or thinking being in the minority about of the total the fact that four people unknown to each other and without being influenced by each others annotation could agree to this level would suggest that it is possible for human annotator to agree on what constitutes the language of suicidal ideation and what is simply a flippant reference to suicide the resulting dataset of tweet wa subsequently used to train a machine learning classifier detail are provided in the next section which is only slightly below the dataset size of other

method on the combined set that resulted in the best set of result a shown in table to the application of pca reduced the feature set from to attribute in term of main component for the seven suicide related class we show in table and the most representative principal component and briefly discus what each class represents in term of the feature in the component and the particular language used in it note that while the distribution of the component per class mirror the total number of annotation per class therefore penalising the class le represented in our data set such a memorial in table and in the related discussion we are giving priority to the most representative class of post containing evidence of possible suicidal intent we can observe the following characteristic of the feature included for each class component c many of the feature that appear dominant in the suicidal ideation class are those related to phrase and expression identified in the suicide literature a being significantly associated within the language of suicide in particular beside a limited number of unibitrigrams generated directly from the training set the term derived from a number of suicide related web site were fundamental in classifying suicidal ideation in twitter data a were the regular expression feature derived from tumblr post example like end it all now and want to be dead and regex including expression of depressivesuicidalself harming thought feeling appear strongly related to suicidal ideation and are clearly discriminating for this specific class other term such a killing myself and the regex containing die my sleep become effective for classification when used besides other attribute such a lexical feature that express surprise exaggeration and emphasis eg adverb really predeterminers eg such rather and word mapped to specific affective domain such a alarm and misery note that some other concept and term appear with a negative correlation a expression of opposite affective state such a security and admiration c for the class representing campaigning and petition we can observe more general concept again expressed by regular expression and language clue wordlists in our terminology such a supporthelp blog a well a more specific term eg safety plea and expression put an end to this some of the wordnet domain feature require further examination a they appear confusing at first for example racing is picking up on the word run and running that are related to campaign c a the confusion matrix in table show the class concerning a flippant use of suicidal language is the one presenting the major difficulty in classification since it includes many of the same linguistic feature of suicidal ideation however the principal component derived for this class identify certain attribute that are the opposite type of sentiment from emotional distress these include affective state such a levity gaiety jollity and cheerfulness a well a popular conversational topic such a casual remark about the weather the confusion occurs where phrase such a kill myself are used frivolously c the class representing post related to information and support and prevention appear mostly represented by specific word often unigrams and tag directly linked to the support service eg police officer internet and suicide andor topicality such a sexual reference lgtb and the domain of selfharm and suicide c for the class concerning memorial message a may be expected direct mention of the name of the deceased appear highly influential a well a time reference eg a month ago a year since in association with term such a killed and died well captured by one of our regular expression in addition label and tag a rip and term expressing love and affection are also part of the component associated with this class again we see some wordnet domain appearing mathematics and agriculture are related to specific word such a add and grow c the class concerning news report related to suicide present feature such a word representing source of information eg bbc news type of news research study or statistical report and direct mention of the name of the deceased a well a general concept related to the particular case such a in the one here reported of the tv domain note that the last three class of memorial informationsupport and news reporting all share the common characteristic of including url link within the tweet which consequently doe not result in an effective feature for discrimination between these different class c finally the class of post annotated a not related to any of the previous class exhibit attribute such a general phrase related to self doubt such a whats wrong with me and hate myself and emotional state such a jitteriness and admiration these are phrase that could appear in tweet relating to emotional distress but are also clearly evident in general everyday

text relating to communication around suicide on twitter the classifier distinguishes between the more worrying content such a suicidal ideation and other suiciderelated topic such a reporting of a suicide memorial campaigning and support we built a set of baseline classifier using lexical structural emotive and psychological feature extracted from twitter post we then improved on the baseline classifier by building an ensemble classifier using the rotation forest algorithm achieving an fmeasure of overall for class including suicidal ideation and for the suicidal ideation class we summarised and attempted to explain the result by reflecting on the most significant predictive principle component of each class to provide insight into the language used on twitter around suiciderelated communication from this analysis we observed that wordlists and regular expression regex extracted from online suiciderelated discussion forum and other microblogging web site appear capable of capturing relevant language clue both in term of single word ngrams wordlists and more complex pattern these appear particularly effective for the suicidal ideation class expressing emotional distress lexical and grammar feature such a po appear mostly ineffective and scarcely present in the principal component only some mention a predeterminers existential clause and superlative that however also relate to more specific affective language feature than only pure lexical one affective lexical domain appear instead very relevant such a those represented by the wordnet library of cognitive synonym and able to well represent the affective and emotional state associated to this particular type of language concept and label representing broader semantic domain also derived form the wordnet library are on the contrary not effective in fact although they appear rather numerous a attribute within the principle component they reveal to be on close inspection for the majority of case irrelevant and mostly generated by a confusion and misrepresentation of word such a sentence like my reason crashed associated to the motorracing domain and suicide watch associated to numismatic sentiment score generated by software tool for sentiment analysis appear also ineffective and either scarcely or not at all included within the principal feature of each class note that this is true for both basic tool that only provide a binary representation of positive and negative score value sentiwordnet a well a more sophisticated text analysis software that generate sentiment score over a larger range of label representing emotional state liwc a classifier for suiciderelated language could potentially make an important contribution to suicide prevention monitoring individual social medium account via keywords that suggest possible suicidal ideation is controversial territory a shown by the recent withdrawal of the samaritan radar app in the uk but there is nonetheless potential for such a lexicon to contribute to prevention in some way a long a acceptability to social medium user is thoroughly investigated the realtime identification of aggregate level of suiciderelated communication at scale in online social network which could be facilitated by the ensemble classifier produced in this research is one possible approach this could potentially aid the identification of emerging suicide cluster and the concentration of suicidal communication following particular event such a a celebrity suicide our classifier go beyond the recognition of suicidal language insofar a it also aid identification of other kind of communication in recognition that social medium platform can be used for multiple purpose including the reporting of news and marshalling of campaign monitoring of suicide news reporting in social medium is another potential avenue where text mining and machine classification technique could be applied the identification of flippant use of suicidal language could be especially useful the method need further development ideally with a larger sample of social medium posting and application to platform other than twitter finally we note that it is important to retain collaboration with domain expert in suicidology throughout the experimental and interpretation phase of future research to improve classification accuracy by incorporating prior

cassel and gore leavy billing and moo stroebe and stroebe it is reported that supportive interaction can have a buffering effect cohen and hoberman that is they can be protective against the negative consequence of mental health consequently social support is recognized to be a significant psychosocial coping resource it therefore bear profound implication for health provision and intervention that attempt to strengthen aspect of support network for individual prone to suicidal thought cohen underwood and gottlieb with the pervasive adoption of social medium platform online community have emerged to be a prime mechanism through which individual with wellbeing challenge seek and obtain help advice and support huh and ackerman perceived support in these community ha been found to be linked to improved selfefficacy and wellbeing fox and jones including facilitating recovery from health challenge newman et al a well a in fostering positive behavior change munson et al despite ample evidence given by crosssectional study of the positive therapeutic role of online support rappaport researcher recognize that necessary and adequate empirical data ha yet to be accumulated to substantiate this claim rudd consequently establishing a causal relationship between availability of online social support and mental health outcome can be challenging this is because most study apply retrospective procedure such a regression and classification model wherein it is difficult to identify comparable subpopulation of user who have the same set of initial symptom it is also plausible that certain individual trait are associated with both the access to social support and the occurrence of atrisk tendency since these symptom and trait are often the best predictor of wellbeing risk like suicidal ideation cohen and hoberman lack of knowledge of baseline condition can have confounding effect in interpreting the link between social support and atrisk state a further threat to validity in crosssectional study of online social support is the potential bias in the retrospective measurement of social support among distressed individual the challenge are compounded by the difficulty in gathering a premorbid or prerisk group of individual who participate in these online community finally qualitative and observational study of support also often fail to reveal condition under which specific type of support can be nonbeneficial or even harmful thoits our work seek to address these methodological gap in assessing the role of online social support in future risk to suicidal ideation to do so we examine publicly shared longitudinal post and comment data on a number of prominent mental health community in the social medium reddit we then identify individual in this data who proceed to post on a reddit suicide support forum at a later point in time due to the semianonymous nature of these community de choudhury and de the content shared by individual allows u to obtain high quality selfreported data around mental health concern and suicidal ideation including data that precedes and succeeds expression of suicidal ideation in individual utilizing comment received on post in these community a a proxy for social support we develop a human machine hybrid statistical methodology that model and quantifies the effect of the language of these comment in individual who do and do not post on the suicide support forum applying stratified propensity score matching rosenbaum and rubin in a iterative fashion we first identify linguistic feature of comment that show significant effect we obtain human assessment on the presence of suicidal ideation risk marker in post associated with these feature then we filter the feature that correspond to comparable subpopulation finally we include these assessment in computing local average treatment effect so a to ass the effect of specific linguistic feature of comment in future risk to suicidal ideation finding our finding show that not all individual posting in the reddit mental health community are equally likely to be influenced by support received through comment those who benefit from online social support tend to show greater social and futuristic orientation interpersonal awareness and lower cognitive impairment we find these observation to align with observation in the psychology literature on suicidal ideation and support kaplan cassel and gore next we qualitatively interpret the context of use of the linguistic feature of the comment that our stratified matching approach identifies to have significant effect on future risk to do so we adopt the social support behavioral code framework of characterizing social support cutrona and suhr we find that linguistic feature used to provide esteem or network support tend to reduce one risk to suicidal ideation in the future somewhat surprisingly feature associated with interpersonal acknowledgment tend to be significantly counterbeneficial we describe how our method and finding can provide insight into the positive and negative impact of online commentary on future mental wellbeing we also discus design and ethical

user in our dataset see figure for a schematic description note that conditioned analysis generally account for observed confounding factor but unlike randomized controlled study cannot account for unobserved confounding factor terminology and data preparation our unit of analysis is an individual reddit user whose experience are characterized by their post to the mh community a well a other user comment on these post we featurize these post and comment a a peruser sequence of timestamped linguistic token or ngrams lowercased and stopword eliminated in our analysis every commenttoken appearing in an user timeline is a treatment on that user in other word a user is said to have received a given treatment if they author a post that receives a comment containing the corresponding token all post and comment token in an user timeline that occur before a given treatment are considered to be covariates representing possible factor that might confound our analysis of the treatment effect on a user measured outcome ie whether or not a user post in mh sw in the future correspondingly a treatment group is the set of user who have received a given treatment and a control group is the set of user who have not received that treatment for a given treatment the result of our analysis is the difference in measured outcome between the treatment and control group conditioned on covariates stratified propensity score analysis stratified propensity score matching attempt to isolate the effect of a particular treatment from the effect of covariates by dividing the treatment and control group into stratum where the covariates of the treatment subgroup within a stratum are statistically identical to the covariates of the control subgroup within a stratum each stratum is thus in essence artificially approximating a randomized controlled trial where the assignment of a treatment is statistically uncorrelated with covariates allowing u to better distinguish the possible causal effect of a treatment on user future participation in mh sw the stratification of user is based on their estimated propensity to receive a given treatment the estimated propensity is a machinelearned function of a user likelihood of receiving a treatment based on the user covariates all prior post and commenttokens once our method ha stratified user we analyze stratum that have common support caliendo and kopeinig within each such stratum the treatment effect is the difference between the measured outcome of the treatment group and the control group in our case this is the difference between the percentage of treated user who eventually participate in mh sw and the percentage of control user who do so the populationweighted combination of these stratalevel effect is the final local average treatment effect where local refers to the fact that we are only estimating over stratum with common support we repeat this entire procedure including the propensity score estimation and stratification for each of our target treatment token implementation in our implementation the propensity score function is estimated using the averaged perceptron learning algorithm freund and schapire estimation is conducted based on a binary vector representation of user timeline where is for a given user if the token i appears in the user timeline of post and comment shared and received prior to the treatment token and otherwise to distinguish between the effect of word written by user themselves and the effect of word written by others in comment we treat an ngram in a comment a being a distinct token from the same ngram appearing in a post given a learned propensity score function we divide our dataset into stratum in addition to the local average treatment effect we report the zscore and test of statistical significance we perform this analysis for all target ngram token that occur in the timeline of more than individual in the mh community

https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14891,10,6,"De Choudhury, Kiciman ",2,1,0,0,2017,when assessing the effect of a comment on a user risk of belonging to mh sw or mh in the future our stratified analysis is comparing a treatment group of user who received a particular comment to a control group of people who did not having indistinguishable distribution of covariates in these two group is very important to ensure that any difference in their likelihood of future posting in sw can be attributed to the fact that one group received the comment and the other group did not however unlike a randomized controlled trial we have no assurance that treatment is independent of unobserved covariates or independent of covariates incorrectly represented from a machine learning perspective in our covariate set this can lead to confounded result therefore ensuring that the stratified group are correctly balanced is critical to correct estimation of outcome ie the likelihood of a user being in mh sw or mh towards this goal in this section we describe an approach to first ass qualitatively the comparability or balance between the treatment and the control group using human judge human judgment of balance are valid in our analysis because it is human commenters who are replying to post and thus deciding whether a user get a treatment or not we then quantitatively measure potential difference in sociolingustic measure and language model between the two group together this approach allows u to identify those subpopulation of treatment and control user who are more likely to be affected by comment on their post in this subsection we present our qualitative approach of assessing balance between treatment and control group belonging to different propensity stratum we first implemented our proposed propensity score matching technique among the mh post and comment of the user in our dataset we identified token that had statistically significant treatment effect negative effect would imply that receiving the comment token decreased chance of being in mh sw and vice versa we randomly sampled token with the most positive or negative zscores for our ensuing qualitative assessment table show a sample of these token thereafter corresponding to each of the selected comment token and spanning different propensity stratum we constructed post pair belonging to the treatment and control user group for each stratum per comment token we randomly select user from the treatment and user from the control group for each of these user we pick their most recent post and all comment they received on that post up until the point of receiving the treatment token or placebo in the case of the control group table give some paraphrased example of post pair thus constructed next we employed two raters an expert in social medium data analysis for mental health and a mental health professional to qualitatively estimate balance in the post pair generated above in other word the raters task wa to identify risk marker of suicidal ideation in the post pair that may not be observable to the propensity score analysis however aligned with known observation of behavior of individual at risk of suicidal ideation in a post pair if the marker aligned we would infer the treatment and control group for that particular comment token and stratum to be balanced if not we would assume that our initial propensity score matching analysis need further tuning to identify more accurately balanced treatment and control group to do so the raters first utilized a codebook of suicidal ideation risk marker developed in de choudhury et al to independently rate a random sample of post pair constructed above to be balanced very similar rating of or imbalanced very dissimilar rating of the risk marker in the codebook were validated in de choudhury et al to align with the cognitive psychological integrative model of suicide dieserud et al they include mention of hopelessness i feel so abandoned anxiety i am feeling panicked impulsiveness right now there only two way to ending it lack of selfesteem i am too ugly to make friend and expression of loneliness i have no one and i never felt such pain following the initial rating exercise followed by resolution of difference the raters rated a larger sample of post pair for balance and imbalance estimation the final agreement wa found to be high cohens an interesting pattern emerged out of the qualitative coding of the post pair figure give a distribution of the balance and imbalance rating over different propensity stratum we observe that the distribution are nearly mirror image of each other that is the balance rating tend to be more frequent among post pair belonging to higher propensity stratum while the imbalance rating peak for pair in the lower propensity stratum the distribution cross each other between stratas and we adopt the lower value a a threshold to identify a set of stratum and corresponding subpopulation of user for which the treatment and control group are balanced propensity stratum we also identify another set where the group and corresponding user subpopulation are not balanced stratum table give some example paraphrased token in our rated sample example stratum corresponding to them and the post pair a can be observed the high propensity stratum post pair exhibit many of the marker of mental health challenge identified in our balance assessment codebook these pair are also semantically similar i have been alone there no way to avoid pain tired of trying and failing feeling like shit but noone to talk to while for the lower propensity stratum post pair only one of the post show these marker of risk to suicidal ideation summarily the example illustrate that our rating that identified post pair of these lower stratum to have greater imbalance the above balance analysis showed that the effect of getting a token in a comment may not be homogeneous certain user may see little effect of getting a token low propensity stratum while others see a large effect higher propensity stratum essentially in what way are the subpopulation of user who fall in the high and low propensity stratum different this is an important consideration in order to understand whether and how user with different characteristic might be le or more likely to be affected by specific token appearing in the comment they receive in their likelihood of being in mh sw in the future to answer this and to give more credence to our qualitative balance assessment we adopted the following quantitative approach specifically we adopt the use of the liwc lexicon chung and pennebaker to quantify the extent to which a variety of sociolinguistic measure are present in the post of the two subpopulation in the high stratum and low propensity stratum stratum let u call them subpopulation h and subpopulation l respectively in table we present the result of our analysis of the subpopulation h and l using the liwc measure our choice of these measure is motivated from prior work where they were used to examine and understand different type of mental health content on social medium de choudhury et al we observe significant difference across the subpopulation a given the diff metricit is the relative percentage difference between the value of a specific measure in the mental health post of subpopulation h and that of subpopulation l the subpopulation h tends to express notably lower anger sadness and na in their post their post also show lower inhibition and higher cognitive processing a shown in the measure of lexical density and awareness this subpopulation also present more awareness of their context and environment de choudhury et al greater use of function word in their post indicates greater logical coherency in their writing style chung and pennebaker interestingly this subpopulation also tends to share more about their health and work and discus more about social and family related concern finally subpopulation h compared to subpopulation l tends to show lower selffocus or selfpreoccupation a noted in the use of their st person singular pronoun conversely the language of their post tends to show higher interpersonal focus through use of nd and rd person pronoun summarily the above qualitative and quantitative analysis reveal significant difference between subpopulation h and l those likely to be affected by commentary h manifest a type of underlying behavior and trait that put them in a position to derive greater benefit or counterbenefit from comment received on their mental health

https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14891,10,7,"De Choudhury, Kiciman ",2,1,0,0,2017,once we identify the reliably balanced stratum comprising user are likely to be affected by commentary on their post we adapt our stratified propensity score algorithm to ignore other stratum and then computing the final outcome effect over the population of treatment and control user in the remaining stratum being calculated only over wellbalanced stratum this local average treatment effect is thus a more reliable estimate of the effect of a particular comment token though it is also more limited in it coverage over the population of user in table we report comment token that give the most negative or positive zscores in distinguishing between mh sw and mh user corresponding to each token we also report the absolute number of user in our dataset out of a total of who received the token in one of their comment treatment count the proportion of user in our data who fell into an unclipped stratum of the token coverage the percent increase in likelihood of belonging to mh sw in the future based on getting the token in a comment in the past local average treatment effect the zscore of the token likelihood of appearance between the two user class and associated statistic and the pointwise mutual information pmi between the comment token and the outcome we find that controlling for historical use of different token in the post of the user a well a the token received by them in the comment associated with these post getting comment token such a gently is helpful fight the enjoyed it nice i really fun totally agree be super instruction significantly decrease a user likelihood of being in mh sw in the future for gently this decrease is for be helpful it is for fight the it is while for instruction it is which are the comment token getting which increase the likelihood of being in mh sw we show comment token with the most positive treatment effect and high zscores in table getting token like proud am sorry suicide medication depressed and pain and hating result in increasing the likelihood of being in mh sw by next we explore the context of usage of the above identified significant comment token this analysis is meant to enable u to understand how different type of social support relate to the outcome of being in mh sw or mh we randomly sampled a set of comment that contained the token identified in table to decrease the likelihood of being in mh sw a well a another comment with the token that were found to increase future risk to being in mh sw we employed qualitative inductive open coding on this sampled corpus to probe into characterizing social support expressed through the token to develop a codebook and a categorization scheme for the sampled comment we followed an iterative semiopen coding procedure we adopted concept and characterization of social support given by the social support behavioral code framework cutrona and suhr and in the literature on mental health suicide and social medium de choudhury and de the raters included a mental health expert and a social medium expert like our balance analysis first the raters independently coded a random subsample of comment then discussed each comment together with assigned code to establish a shared vocabulary next they independently coded the remaining comment based on the shared vocabulary and social support coding scheme thus developed interrater reliability cohens for this task wa found to be high the final set of social support code that described the comment included emotional esteem informational instrumental and network support a well a interpersonal acknowledgment aligning with the type given in prior work cutrona and suhr table give example comment expert associated with these category the comment excerpt in table help u understand in what way the token identified to have large effect on one likelihood of being in mh sw in the future are used in social support context we observe that emotional support range from relating to specific challenging life situation totally agree to expressing empathy over how they impact one life not alone esteem support can include boosting one morale to fight the stigma of mental illness fight the or encouraging hope and uplifting thought despite distressful experience misery through informational support commenters provide advice and suggestion to seek professional mental health help be tough therapy and medication medication commenters also provide various form of instrumental support including selfimprovement activity like involvement in pastime a hobby next network support comment express solidarity connection and social integration is helpful finally acknowledgment of social support include explicit recognition of the post author feeling be super thought or experience depressed while the context of use of the specific token with significant treatment effect did not reveal notable difference between the likelihood of being in mh and mh sw the relative manifestation of the different social support category in comment for the two user class did show sharp contrast this is observable from figure that give the distribution of the different support category over the coded comment associated with mh and mh sw a kruskal wallis oneway analysis of variance test indicates that the difference between these two distribution of social support type is significant for the coded comment associated with mh we find greater expression of esteem and network support followed by emotional support informational support and acknowledgment tend to be relatively lower for comment containing token that decrease likelihood of posting in sw overall this distribution indicates the positive impact of esteem and network support in reducing one future risk of suicidal ideation expression however the coded comment in mh sw tend to involve largely acknowledgment and informational support instrumental and network support constitute the smallest category for these comment it appears that receiving acknowledgment of one feeling or advice around mental health issue do not translate to reduced future expression of suicidal ideation this analysis demonstrates how our propensity score analysis method can enable u understand the usefulness of various type of support to probe further we sought to directly examine how some of the comment token with large effect negative or positive are used in specific social support context in figure ab we report these finding for five comment token with the largest negative and positive treatment effect ref table the relative distribution of support type reported in this figure were determined based on the qualitatively coded comment above aligning with our above observation we find that token associated with negative treatment effect appear in comment that our raters coded to be related to emotional esteem or network support on the other hand we observe that comment token that increase the likelihood of being in mh sw ie are counterbeneficial occur in comment spanning interpersonal acknowledgment and those that

estimated million people of all age suffer from depression depressed people have various depression symptom manifested by distinguishing behavior in clinical diagnosis psychological doctor often make facetoface interview referring to the commonly used diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder criterion nine class of depression symptom are defined in the criterion describing the distinguishing behavior on daily life although this is the most effective method for depression diagnosis people are somehow ashamed or unaware of depression more than of people in the early stage of depression would not consult the psychological doctor deteriorating their condition on the other hand people are increasingly relying on social medium platform like twitter and facebook to disclose emotion and mood a well a share their personal status the user generated content ugc on social medium instantly reflect not only the daily life but also the mental state of user in the past decade social medium were widely used for physical and mental wellness research especially the mental wellness coppersmith et al lin et al akbari et al inspired by these some effort have been dedicated to depression study some researcher asked user to fill questionnaire or participate interview on social medium for example park et al analyzed behavior and the use of language of depressed user on twitter these method are effective but expensive timeconsuming and hard to get sufficient data to guarantee their finding are robust and generalizable besides these questionnaire and interview focus on the depression behavior already defined in depression criterion however the symptom of depression evolve a the world develops especially the online behavior which may not be covered detailedly in the previous depression criterion on the other hand some work considered online behavior on social medium choudhury et al extracted several feature group like engagement and emotion feature to detect depressed user on twitter however these feature group were not regarded a different modality so that the relation across different feature group can hardly be captured without a systematic multimodal framework in this paper we work towards timely depression detection via harvesting social medium this work is nontrival owning to the following challenge a far a we know there is no public available largescale benchmark datasets for depression research that are suitable to our study user behavior on social medium are multifaceted it is hard to characterize the user from discriminant perspective and capture the relation across different modality although user behavior are rich and diverse only a few are symptom of depression so the depressiveoriented feature are sparse on social medium and hard to be captured towards this end we first construct welllabeled depression and non depression datasets on twitter by rulebased heuristic method second to represent each user in our datasets we extract depressionoriented feature inspired not only by the offline symptom from the depression criterion but also online behavior on social medium these feature are composed of six group namely social network feature user profile feature visual feature emotional feature topiclevel feature and domainspecific feature third taking each feature group a a single modality we devise a multimodal depressive dictionary learning model mdl to learn the sparse user representation in addition to the sparse representation this model also considers the relation among the six modality we carry out extensive experiment on the labeled datasets to validate our model to better than baseline in term of fmeasure and analyze the contribution of feature finally we conduct a series of case study to reveal the underlying behavior discrepancy between depressed and nondepressed user on social medium on account of the limited user on welllabeled depression dataset we construct a largescale dataset on twitter and uncover more depressed user by our proposed method in particular we get some statistical finding such a depressed user tend to leak off more emotion on social medium especially negative emotion their negative emotion word are more than those of nondepressed user depressed user tend to post more tweet between and on average more detailed result can be found in section our framework is presented in figure we summarize the main contribution in three aspect we construct benchmark datasets for online depression detection and analysis including the welllabeled depression and nondepression datasets a well a a largescale depressioncandidate dataset in addition we release these datasets with feature to facilitate wellness study for computer science and psychology we extract six group of discriminant depressionoriented feature to describe user from different aspect a only few of the user behavior are symptom of depression we present a multimodal depressive dictionary learning model to learn the sparse representation of user our method can be used to timely detect depression take proactive care to prevent the depressed condition to be deteriorated we analyze feature contribution and online behavior of depression we make our effort to reveal the behavior not covered in depression criterion trying to provide more perspective and insight for depression

presented in our datareleased website for more detail social network feature it wa found that depressed user are le active in social network and depressed individual perceived twitter more a a tool for social awareness and emotional interaction park et al therefore the social network feature were worth considering such a number of tweet we extracted the number of tweet posted historically and recently by the given user to ass the user activeness social interaction we considered the social interaction feature such a the number of the user following and follower to describe user online social behavior posting behavior we also extracted the different posting behavior of user to reflect the state of their life such a the posting time distribution user profile feature the user profile feature refer to user personal information in social network it wa found that people having a college degree or a regular job are le likely to be depressed park et al however there are quite few

brightness saturation cool color ratio and clear color ratio a visual feature emotional feature emotional status of depressed user differs from that of common user so the emotional feature are beneficial in depression detection we studied emotion word we extracted positive and negative word count in recent tweet with liwc pennebaker et al emoji we invited three annotator to vote for the sentiment of the emoji in our library mentioned before based on the majority voting we obtained a sentimental emoji library with which we extracted the sentimental emoji count vad feature we leveraged

antidepressant we established a lexicon of antidepressant from the wikipedia page of antidepressant with which we counted the average number of antidepressant name mentioned depression symptom referring to the nine group of symptom in dsmiv criterion we extracted the corresponding keywords respectively however different from the formal text in the criterion the linguistic style varies

limited than for many physical condition a sufferer may relapse even after successful treatment or exhibit resistance to different treatment most mental health condition begin early disrupt education kessler et al and may persist over a lifetime causing disability when those affected would normally be at their most productive kessler and frank for example patel and knapp estimated the aggregate cost of all mental disorder in the united kingdom at billion price of which wa due to lost productivity patel and knapp the global burden of mental and substance use disorder increased by between and whiteford et al which mean it is an international public health priority to effectively prevent and treat mental health issue in the uk of adult experience a subthreshold common mental disorder mcmanus et al and up to of individual with nonpsychotic common mental disorder have subthreshold psychotic symptom kelleher et al showing that a large proportion of mental illness is unrecognised but nevertheless ha a significant impact upon people life those people with condition that meet criterion for diagnosis are treated in primary care or by mental health professional study consistently show that between of all individual with a serious mental illness receive treatment for their mental health problem at any given time kessler et al however most of the pathology tracking and improvement assessment is done through questionnaire eg the personal health questionnaire phq for depression kroenke and spitzer and require a subjective comment by the patient eg how many day have you been bothered with little interest or pleasure in doing thing in the past two week a with every personal judgement the response are influenced by the environment in which the person ha been asked the

set questionnaire and may not fit with the main concern of a patient social medium such a twitter facebook and reddit have become an accepted platform to communicate about life circumstance and experience a specific example of social medium in the context of illness is patientslikeme wick et al patientslikeme ha been developed to enable people suffering from an illness to exchange information with others with the same condition eg to find alternative treatment opportunity it ha been shown that the support received in such online community can be empowering by engendering selfrespect and a feeling of being in control of the situation barak et al hence social medium constitutes a tremendous resource for better understanding disease from a patient perspective social medium data ha recently been recognised a one of the resource to gather knowledge about mental illness coppersmith et al a de choudhury et al kumar et al for example twitter data ha been used to develop classifier to recognise depression in user de choudhury et al and to classify twitter user who have attempted suicide from those who have not and from those who are clinically depressed coppersmith et al b furthermore data collected from reddit pertaining to suicidal ideation could demonstrate the existence of the werther effect suicide attempt and completion after medium depiction of an individual suicide kumar et al coppersmith and colleague used twitter data to determine language feature that could be used to classify twitter user into suffering from mental health problem and unaffected individual coppersmith et al a however while the author could identify feature that allows the classification between healthy and unhealthy twitter user they also note that language difference in communicating about the different mental health problem remains an open question similarly mitchell et al used twitter data to separate user affected by schizophrenia from healthy individual by automatically identifying characteristic language feature for schizophrenia mitchell et al both the latter approach rely on the linguistic inquiry and word count liwc tausczik and pennebaker but mitchell et al also cover feature such a latent dirichlet allocation and brown clustering very recently and concurrently with our own work de choudhury and colleague have shown that linguistic feature can be used to predict the likelihood of individual transitioning from posting about depression and other mental health issue on reddit to suicidal ideation de choudhury et al this work showed the ability to make causal inference on the basis of language usage and employed a small subset of the mental health group on reddit following on from the promise that such work hold our goal wa to study language feature that are characteristic for individual mental health condition using large scale reddit data we anticipate that our finding can be used to assist in separating post pertaining to different mental health problem and for various languagebased application involving the better understanding of mental health condition reddit is particularly suitable for such research a it ha an enormous user base post and comment are topicspecific and the data is publicly available we focussed on subreddits community where user can postcomment in relation to a specific topic eg suicide ideation of the reddit data dump that address the following mental health problem addiction anxiety aspergers autism bipolar disorder dementia depression schizophrenia self harm and suicide ideation these condition are commonly encountered by mental health practitioner and contribute significantly to treatment cost we aimed to identify linguistic characteristic that are specific to any of the mental illness covered and can be used for text classification task the investigated characteristic include lexical a well a syntactic feature the uniqueness of vocabulary and the expression of sentiment and happiness our result suggest that there are linguistic feature that are discriminative of the user community used in this study furthermore applying a clustering method on subreddits we could show that subreddits mostly contain a topicspecific vocabulary moreover we could also highlight that there are difference in the way that sentiment is expressed in each of the subreddits source

use can be characterised through a variety of feature type our aim is to better understand the nature and depth of the communication that take place and one way to do this is by the analysis of linguistic feature these feature are particularly relevant in the context of mental health problem a the ability of the sufferer to effectively communicate can be affected by such problem cohen and elvevag for example someone suffering from bipolar disorder may suddenly write a lot but not necessarily in a cohesive manner in the iowa writer workshop study andreasen bipolar sufferer reported that they were unable to work creatively during period of depression or mania during depressive episode cognitive fluency and energy were decreased and during manic period they were too distractible and disorganized to work effectively so it would be reasonable to expect this to be reflected in their prose understanding these feature and consequently the nature and content of the post will allow u to better design useful classification system and predictive model through discussion we determined an initial feature set of linguistic characteristic that draw on previously established measure of psychological relevance such a liwc and cohmetrix graesser et al however we note here that in order to not overload our initial feature set we selected a subset of all the available possibility in our feature set we included linguistic feature introduced by pitler and nenkova pitler and nenkova and partially overlapping with those used in cohmetrix for predicting text quality more specifically we adopt feature that aim at assessing the readability of textual content readability is a measurement that aim to ass the required education level for a reader to fully appreciate a certain content the task of understanding textual content and assessing it quality encompasses various factor that are captured through the feature that we also propose here see supplemental material for more information about the implementation a subset of these feature have been used successfully to predict the answer to be marked a accepted in online communitybased question answering website gkotsis et al our first set of feature pertains to the usage of specific word in document for instance we look at the usage of definite article since we believe that definite article are used for specific and personal communication similarly we keep track of pronoun firstperson pronoun and the ratio between them a indicator of the degree of firstperson content additional feature in this initial set aimed at examining text complexity in our approach text complexity can scale both horizontally length topic cohesion and vertically clause composite meaning for the horizontal assessment we count the number of sentence another set of feature which target the understanding of topic continuity and cohesion across sentence is word overlap between adjacent sentence either by taking into account all word or just noun and pronoun for the vertical assessment we employ the following feature a we count the noun chunk and verb phrase sequence of noun and verb respectively and the number of word contained within them b we construct the parse tree of each sentence and measure it height and c we count the number of subordinate conjunction eg although because etc a parse tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence and tool such a dependency or constituency parser are readily available for utilisation eg a implemented in the python module spacy finally we found that a few post do not contain any text in their body apart from their title this wa typically the case for post that contained a uniform resource locator url to a web page of interest to the community we believe that the ratio of the number of these post over the total number of post is associated with the degree of information dissemination a opposed to the personal storytelling that might occur in other case and thus included

illness and risk behaviour in much closer detail than previously however narrative note are written by clinician who record those positive finding and relevant negative that guide their subsequent diagnosis and treatment plan for the patient although ehrs allow clinician to synthesise disparate fact making them interpretable by other clinician they do not paint a full picture of the patient experience of a mental health problem particularly a patient may answer interview question in a manner that they perceive will be viewed favourably by their clinician moreover a patient record are only written based on meeting with their healthcare provider critical change in patient behaviour and wellbeing may not be recognised either immediately or at all due to a time delay in reporting thus preventing certain real time intervention social medium is changing the way people selfidentify a suffering from a disorder and how they communicate with others with similar experience often asking about side effect from treatment or sharing coping skill and thereby feeling le isolation or stigma studying popular social medium platform such a twitter and reddit hold the key to understanding what concern patient rather than clinician most furthermore this type of largescale usergenerated content offer the opportunity to understand mechanism underlying mental health condition at an unprecedented level for instance study of child and adolescent have already shown that high daily use of social networking site may be independently associated with poor selfrating of mental health and experience of higher level of psychological distress and suicidal ideation following on from our initial study here we present the second phase of our research on classifying usergenerated content from reddit that is related to different type of mental health condition we aimed to study the most epidemiologically prevalent and clinically burdensome mental health condition depression bipolar disorder anxiety disorder schizophrenia a described in the study by whiteford et al a in this most recent global clinical study we also studied drug use disorder general addiction opiate addiction and alcoholism separately with a many a of suicide death attributable to mental and substance use disorder it wa also relevant to study both suicide and selfharm behaviour we captured pervasive developmental disorder by studying autism and regarded it a important to also include borderline personality disorder a an important example of a group for whom sparse global epidemiological data is available but who form a large and active online community in this paper we address the problem of automated classification of mental healthrelated content on a social medium platform our longterm goal is to not only aid clinical researcher epidemiologist and policy maker in understanding and addressing communication on social medium but also to provide support for people suffering from mental illness here we propose an approach to automatically identify reddit post related to mental health binary classification and then classify mental healthrelated post according to themebased subreddit grouping multiclass classification using deep learning technique accompanied with manual content and topic analysis we employ a themebased approach to this problem and compare result with alternative machine learning baseline with reddit providing monitoring and support through volunteer being able to classify post according to theme could enable alerting moderator by reposting post to relevant communication thread if they have not been posted there yet we also believe that the result and the methodology presented here is useful to gain a deeper understanding and to characterise language and

classification strategy a binary classification to determine whether or not a post contains mental health related content and multiclass classification to identify the mental health condition theme a post is referring to our result show that by applying a cnn approach in the binary classification task we achieve an accuracy of in distinguising the mental health related post from unrelated post further to that we can identify reddit post a belonging to one of the defined theme with an overall weighted precision of and a recall of fm taken in conjunction these result suggest that we can reliably identify mental health content and determine the mental health theme that is further referred to in the post assuming that there is sufficient data for disorder to train the model on in our approach we assessed post from several subreddits that were grouped into theme despite the manual and automated verification of the generated theme there is an intrinsic overlap of post content across the theme due to the relatedness of mental health condition for example a can be seen from the confusion matrix in fig a large number of opiate post are misclassified a cripplingalcoholism and vice versa both theme refer to a substance addiction indicating shared language feature to a larger degree than with other subreddits furthermore it is worth noting that both subreddits contain strong language that is not a clearly represented in any of the other subreddits and both subreddits allow for post that embrace addiction similarly a high rate of post are misclassified between the selfharm and suicidewatch subreddits both of which feature behaviour associated with mental and emotional distress we chose to use topic modelling a a mean of automatically obtaining key characteristic word and phrase from the post a it ha been applied successfully in similar setting in other study eg schwartz et al the topic model shown in supplement each topic is using the most descriptive keywords align with the manually created theme and an extension of this work could be to further optimise the validation approach by scaling the number of topic retrieved with the number of available post in the theme the control group built for the first task see section control dataset generation in method for more detail utilises the author information of user who post on mental healthrelated subreddits we opted for this approach due to the long computation time required for calculating age and gender estimate for individual post and the number of post that need to be matched in general age and gender matching is desired to avoid influence originating from gender or age difference in language use while we used all user posting on mental health subreddits only a subset of author appears in the control dataset around of the user appear in the non mental health subreddits and appear in the mental health subreddits moreover this intersection of usersauthors is responsible for post in the mental health subreddits which corresponds to only of the mental health post see supplement figure s for more detail this may be partially explained by user not wanting to be recognised by other reddit user or peer and therefore disguising their identity by using so called throwaway account hence the result presented here concern case where author between the two class are largely different our study doe not focus on such case where author post simultaneously under both class it ha been demonstrated in the past that characteristic linguistic feature are apparent in those suffering from mental illness this mean that our dataset could have limitation in being applicable to ass linguistic difference between mental health and nonmental health related post a linguistic feature are likely to be present in both the mental health and control post with regard to our result this is likely to increase the difficulty of our classification task a we are aiming to use the content to determine mental health and nonmental health post on the contrary if we were to create a control group that is entirely unrelated it is possible that our performance measure currently bestperforming accuracy for cnn might increase concerning the classification task and the deep learning approach presented we experimented with different setting and threshold we considered pretrained word vector a input to the classifier eg using glove common crawl containing billion token but the result did not improve we attribute this to the size of our dataset which is adequate for representing the language within the corpus furthermore we experimented with increasing the complexity of our network in different part such a the dimension of the input vector the overall topology of the network a well a different activation and objective function in all the configuration experimented with the accuracy of the classification did not improve which is why we kept the simplest configuration our result for the multiclass classification are satisfactory and provide some interesting insight there is some variability in classlevel result for instance for opiate fm is a high a while for addiction result are lower when studying the confusion matrix fig the most common misclassification is depression for which there are two main explanation the first reason is that depression is the most populous class so the training of the classifier may have resulted in a bias favouring this class the second reason is that depression is often a secondary symptom of other mental health problem and show considerable comorbidity with other mental health disorder this is also confirmed through our manual survey of the content of the post see section manual characterisation of subreddits where it wa found that post from different theme may also concern depression and where post in the depression subreddit may be related to more than just depression to further support the above we conducted an experiment whereby we removed the most prevalent classtheme depression which account for of the post and repeated the same multiclass classification task contrary to the typical behaviour in such setting the removal of the most prevalent class resulted in an increase in the accuracy more specifically all classifier improved and cnn performs the best with accuracy more than improvement this finding further support the notion that the class in our problem are neither orthogonal nor mutually exclusive in nature when considering a le strict evaluation metric ie instead of truefalse a in classification task such a mean reciprocal rank ie the position at which a theme ranked compared to the actual class the result improve significantly more than across all classifier this finding also highlight the fact that some of the theme are highly interrelated and not always distinguishable a separate and exclusive class for example a common symptom of depression is suicidal ideation which in consequence mean that a person posting on depression may express suicidal thought which are the content of communication on suicidewatch concerning the binary classification task we notice that the simple ff network achieves similar performance to the more sophisticated cnn le than drop in accuracy concluding that the binary classification problem is captured sufficiently using a more simple neural network one limitation of our approach is the number of mental health theme that are used in the multiclass classification task in order to cover more theme our model built for the multiclass classification would require additional data however the way the approach is implemented more theme can be added over time and the only cost is that the prediction model need to be retrained and performance reassessed in conclusion our suggested method is applicable to the identification of post relevant to a mental health subreddit a well a the identification of the actual mental health theme they relate to being able to classify post in this manner is the first step in the direction of targeted intervention eg by redirecting post that seem in need of urgent moderator attention in future work we aim to further improve the classification into mental health theme multiclass classification address interrelated theme eg by employing hierarchical structure increase the coverage of mental health theme and devise an urgency scheme to come closer to the aforementioned notification system in the frame of realtime personalised

widely adopted a a lens to provide insight into behavior mood psychological trait and state and social interaction of individual for mental health a growing body of work including that in the human computer interaction hci field is leveraging naturalistic unobtrusive data from social medium to predict mental health state of individual parallel to hci in an emergent field called digital psychiatry clinician are exploring the efficacy of diagnostic prediction from online data for early diagnosis evidencebased treatment and deploying timely patientprovider intervention in this line of research on the methodological front supervised machine learning technique have gained prominence providing promising predictive outcome of mental health state the success of these technique however hinge on access to ample and highquality gold standard label for model training in mental health gold standard label often comprise diagnostic signal of people clinical mental health state for instance whether an individual might be suffering from a specific mental illness or at the cusp of experiencing an adverse episode like a relapse or suicidal thought unlike conventional machine learning task in field like computer vision and natural language processing extensive high quality gold standard data for predicting clinical diagnosis of mental illness from social medium is not readily available literature ha advocated the use of clinically validated diagnostic information collected from patient population for building such predictive model however undertaking such effort present many practical and logistical challenge these range from the difficulty in recruiting a sensitive and high risk population to the myriad privacy and ethical concern that accompany engaging directly with vulnerable individual because of the effort and timeconsuming nature of such data acquisition approach and the need for deepseated crossdisciplinary partnership particularly with clinician researcher have noted such data acquisition effort to not scale easily and quickly to large and diverse population consequently researcher have operationalized a variety of online behavior a diagnostic signal to build machine learning approach that predict mental illness diagnosis these proxy are easily accessible and inexpensively gathered from social medium without the need to directly engage with the individual themselveswe define binary indicator of the presence or absence of these social medium behavior that might correspond to their clinical mental health state a proxy diagnostic signal one notable example from literature consists of public selfreports of mental illness made by individual in their social medium feed this paper posit a significant challenge in using these proxy diagnostic signal revolving around their lack of clinical grounding theoretical contextualization and psychometric validityconcerns noted by psychiatrist and computational researcher alike in other word drawing on boyd and crawford critique despite gain in scale gap exist in our understanding of how these signal are defined where their theoretical underpinnings are whether they objectively and accurately measure what they claim to measure that is the clinical mental illness diagnosis and whether the pattern of behavior they exemplify are truly representative of the behavior of patient more generally our position is situated in criticism in the broader social medium research area where the use of online data removed from the individual and the specific offline context and collected without their direct involvement pose natural challenge to evaluation our contribution toward addressing the above methodological gap this paper present a first empirical study to ass the quality of different social mediaderived proxy diagnostic signal in predicting clinical diagnosis of mental illness for treatment and patientprovider intervention focusing on the specific mental illness of schizophrenia and drawing upon an involved partnership between hci and clinical researcher we consider three proxy signal widely used in prior literature behavior signaling affiliation to mental health resource selfreported diagnosis and clinically appraised selfreports of diagnosis adopting data triangulation and modern validity theory a methodological foundation we examine their predictive validity internal and external to do so we design a prediction task to distinguish those with schizophrenia from control population and leverage a carefullycurated social medium dataset of clinically diagnosed schizophrenia patient seeking treatment at a large healthcare organization we find that although the three diagnostic signal demonstrate strong internal validity reproducing what wa established by the original work they perform poorly on the clinically diagnosed patient data thus suffering from poor external validity among the three signal we find that the model that us affiliation behavior a gold standard lead to the poorest performance our result also reveal that incorporating clinical judgment via appraisal of social medium selfreports of mental illness lead to the best performance among the proxy signal when tested on clinical patient data however we find that all classifier trained with the proxy diagnostic signal perform significantly poorly when compared to a model built using the data of the schizophrenia patient population a deep dive in the performance of these classifier via an error analysis reveals several methodological gap in the way these diagnostic signal are conceived and employed in the predictive framework these gap range from uncertainty in the construct validity of the proxy signal and poor theoretical grounding to a variety of

external validity of the proxy classifier we present a deeper analysis of the proxy classifier performance error analysis we begin by unpacking mismatch in prediction made by the proxy classifier on unseen patient data in term of example false positive and false negative unpacking false positive classification consider an example x who is a healthy control per a clinically validated diagnostic assessment but the affiliation model wrongly predicted them a having schizophrenia examining their social medium timeline we find paraphrased post including excerpt such a mental screenshot of note are you bad for my mental health and use my phone in day mode because i am mentally ill we note that term like mental health illness in these excerpt are highly predictive of the positive class in the affiliation model leading to because the affiliation model simply measure engagement association with or interest in mental health content and resource it missed capturing the context in which these topic were discussed by x leading to a misclassification of x a a schizophrenia patient now consider a healthy control participant y timeline it includes prolific usage of term such a creepy hell jesus and help these token are learned a highly predictive of the positive class by the appraised selfreport model thereby leading to a misclassification of y although these token reveal symptomatic expression spirituality and supportseeking behavior notable in schizophrenia disclosure made on social medium the current example demonstrates varied usage of these token by healthy control in reference to popculture or in casual conversation we frame these observation a the following methodological gap that the outcome yielded by the proxy classifier are not valid indicator of a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia poor construct validity and that the behavior of individual captured by the proxy signal might not be representative of the behavior of schizophrenia patient sampling bias unpacking false negative classification consider a different example a a clinically diagnosed patient with schizophrenia their social medium timeline data show extensive usage of swear term such a fuck as bitch that according to theaffiliation model were highly predictive of the negative class resulting in a false negative classification consider example b a schizophrenia patient whose timeline largely consisted of travel and hobby related post with no evidence of schizophrenia experience the appraised selfreport model predicted b a a healthy control due to lack of explicit disclosure of the illness like symptomatic expression and personal struggle feature importance for liwc category anger body swear anxiety these difference reveal that the proxy signal are not measuring what they intend to measure poor construct validity further that the social medium language of patient might not be very different from control user population bias issue of dataset shift bias the population and sampling bias revealed by our error analysis go on to show that the statistical data distribution might be drastically different between the proxy datasets and the actual patient dataset a phenomenon referred to a dataset shift a a next step in our deep dive we present the following analysis to systematically examine this dataset shift and ass it effect specifically to quantify dataset shift we adopt a measure of semantic distance computation between the linguistic content of proxy and patient datasets to represent the proxy data distribution we first identify the most frequent ngrams from the positive class per proxy classifier and compute the word vector representation for each of these ngrams similarly we represent the positive class for the test distribution ie the data of all schizophrenia patient in the word vector space we finally compute the cosine similarity between the proxy and patient data in the vector space our result bolster the finding of the error analysis wherein we observe the farthest distance between the proxy and patient data in case of the affiliation dataset similarity distance the selfreport dataset is at a closer semantic distance to the patient data distribution than the affiliation data with a distance of and similarity of finally confirming the observation thus far the appraised selfreport dataset appears at the closest distance to the patient data with a distance of and similarity of issue of construct validity a second issue revealed by our error analysis wa that the behavioral pattern learned by the proxy classifier were absent in the schizophrenia patient population raising concern around construct validity therefore next we examine the feature learned by the proxy classifier in comparison to the feature learned by the patient model table show the top feature and their feature weight for the worst and best proxy classifier and the patient model overlap of feature comparing the top feature of the affiliation model with the patient model we see little overlap between the two feature space prominently in term of use of first person pronoun and liwc category term about social and body we find that these feature are predictive of one class in the affiliation model whereas predictive of the opposite class in the patient model further comparing the top feature of the appraised selfreport model with the patient model we see a higher overlap than in the case of the affiliation model some of these feature such a feeling help and use of first person pronoun are predictive of the positive class in both model which explains the higher external validity of the appraised selfreport model however we find that there are also a number of feature predictive of the positive class in the appraised selfreport model that are associated with the negative class in the patient model eg liwc category of present tense body verb and token such a crazy although the appraised selfreport model is accurately learning certain pattern specific to the patient population it misconstrues explicit mental illness disclosure behavior symptomatic expression combating stigma and support seeking a signal of a schizophrenia diagnosis mismatch of feature finally we observe that the most predictive feature of the positive class in the affiliation model are explicit signal of mental health care and support mental health illness depression stigma mhchat that have few occurrencesin the patient data similarlyin the case of the appraised selfreport model content related to schizophrenia experience die alone sorry creepy liwc category of negative affect and negation are either missing or not predictive of the positive class in the patient model therefore we argue that what these proxy classifier actually learn is the

the proxy diagnostic signal we observed is the uncertainty in their construct validity drawing on the definition of this construct we explore two methodological implication do these diagnostic signal measure what they claim to measure our result show that the diagnostic signal are not measuring what they claim ie the clinical diagnosis of an individual mental healthschizophrenia state this is revealed by the considerable mismatch we observed while comparing the top predictive feature of the proxy classifier and those of the patient model unpacking the context of these feature in the actual social medium post we found that they capture support seeking behavior interest in others lived experience of the illness selfreported account of stigma and inhibition pattern absent from the feature of the patient model from the clinical schizophrenia population is what is being measured by a diagnostic signal itself valid to the latter point about construct validity we found a lack of clinical grounding in the diagnostic information individual clinical mental health state that these signal intend to measure instead what these signal presume a diagnostic information are essentially behavioral pattern associated with the appropriation of social medium by a wide variety of stakeholder not necessarily patient in relation to the illness these form of appropriationincludeindividuals posting resource for mental health awareness individual seeking therapeutic benefit or individual breaking free inhibition and mental health stigma by disclosing their illness although these appropriation pattern can be a valuable resource to understand the experience of schizophrenia they do not provide clinically grounded information about an individual diagnosis of a mental illnessthereby making them le suitable for the prediction task in this paper although the appraised selfreport diagnostic signal attempt to overcome lack of clinical grounding it suffers from other limitation that affect it construct validity first of all the clinical expert who appraised the selfreports of schizophrenia did not have access to the person clinical history or symptom and experience collateral information information beyond a patient explicit selfreports of symptom are also critical and mainstream in any clinical mental illness diagnosis and our clinical diagnostic signal derived from the patient factor this information through use of tool like psdq and scid however for the appraised diagnostic signal the clinician can only gather collateral information from the content of the social medium post this may not be sufficient for a valid diagnosis given the limited context of what people consciously or subconsciously choose to share on social medium and vast amount of collateral information might exist offline which the appraising clinician did not have access to theoretical contextualization related to the above two issue lie another limitation which is a lack of theoretical underpinning in the way the diagnostic signal were identified all of the scale and questionnaire used for clinical diagnosis including the one used in this paper patient population draw upon theoretical framework such a neurobiology dimensional personality assessment behavioral science psychodynamic and cognitive theory they undergo rigorous psychometric testing and are continually adjusted a the framework around mental illness evolve or a the dsm or more recently the national institute of mental health introduced research domain criterion rdoc framework offer newer guideline for mental health diagnostic and treatment the proxy diagnostic signal are however not inspired by this theory instead they focus on online behavior which may or may not align with theoretical model framework or guideline of mental illness the other methodological gap we identify in the use of the proxy diagnostic signal for predicting clinical diagnosis relates to dataset shift in the literature datasets shift in supervised learning are attributed to population or data sampling bias inherent in the data we therefore discus the foundation of this phenomenon in two way population bias we observed that the datasets built using the proxy diagnostic signal include social medium data of a unique set of individual who may not be representative of schizophrenia patient who are actually diagnosed with the illness and under treatment consequently this population bias may manifest in several different way the social medium activity of an individual who follows online mental health resource may be different from someone who publicly discloses their illness and experiencesand these in turn might be different from a clinically diagnosed patient social medium usage and behavior the diagnostic signal capture subpopulation who may not be truthfully reporting their illness or may be reporting about their selfderived assessment of a mental illness experience in an exaggerated fashion that did not involve the feedback of a clinician and the diagnostic signal consist of subpopulation who may not be mental illness patient currently under treatment and the social medium activity of those who are under formal care and those who are not might be considerably different data sampling bias the observed dataset shift between the proxy datasets and the schizophrenia patient datamay also be stemming from a type of sampling bias related to boundary regulation preference of the individual and the use of public versus private account individual identified using these online diagnostic signal have largely public social medium account however the clinically diagnosed patient we considered largely had private account this difference in boundary regulation and privacy choice between the schizophrenia patient and the individual captured via the diagnostic signal might lead to sampling bias in the proxy datasets identifying and quantifying the bias between the population targeted by the diagnostic signal alongside examining their theoretical and construct validity is therefore crucial before the signal are deployed to make clinical prediction clinical patientprovider implication alongside the methodological implication of making prediction of mental illness diagnosis with the proxy diagnostic signal it is equally important to consider their impact on the key stakeholder such a clinician and patient to the clinician community whose primary source of diagnostic information comprises clinically validated questionnaire scale interview and symptom reported by the patient these new form of proxy diagnostic signal derived from social medium despite the right intention add complexity to the conventional psychiatric assessment method we highlight some of these complexity in the question below for instance in the absence of supplementary and accessible detail of their inner working and bias how can clinician trust these new form of diagnostic signal and their validity and thereafter act upon them how do these new signal complement or even contradict clinician mental model of reasoning or how clinician pursue diagnosis and treatment of their patient importantly decisionmaking by the clinician for diagnosis treatment or patientprovider intervention involves both high stake and high cost therefore incorrect prediction made a a result of data with poor external construct validity or those suffering from population and sampling bias can be dangerous and have serious consequence for the patient wellbeing and social and professional life while personalized patient care is touted a a strong motivation for adopting socialmedia for clinical diagnosis and treatment validity and bias issue may additionally adversely impact patient trust and attitude towards mental healthcare when outcome of these proxy classifier are incorporated into clinical decision without the patient awareness poor validity can even negativelyimpact patient perceived agencyin treatment or the therapeutic relationship they share with their clinician these issue may further conflict with patient preference need and value in treatment thus bridging these methodological gap with interaction with and involvement of the patient and clinician stakeholder is key to translating the potential of social medium to support clinical diagnosis and

researcher to bolster effort in examining and establishing the efficacy of social medium based signal for prediction of mental health state in clinical population improving methodological rigor and adopting alternative research design a first set of guideline center around reducing or eliminating the issue noted above we conjecture that combining multiple proxy diagnostic signal especially those that are complementary to each other could provide more rigor because of their potential to target more diverse social medium population however this warrant empirical investigation alternatively given the stigma around experience of mental illness some of the proxy diagnostic signal can be leveraged in a respondentdriven sampling framework this can be a viable mechanism to reach and recruit individual for clinical study that seek to collect gold standard patient data implementing an onlineoffline framework that combine social medium data with preexisting offline longitudinal information of comparable subpopulation can also reduce the dataset shift challenge further issue of dataset shift can be overcome by adopting recent approach from the machine learning field such a including importance weighting of training instance based on similarity to test set and employing online learning of prediction model to identify and recover from incorrect prediction crowdsourcing based data analysis and replication effort can also be used to make transparent the impact of proxy dataset bias on predictive model buildingandutilizing sharedinfrastructures fordatacollection and data donation effort one next guideline center around building contributing to and leveraging shared infrastructure and data repository for conducting this research our finding showed the value of using patient data in building predictive model of mental illness diagnosis however we recognize that researcher without access to patient population within large healthcare system or without involved collaboration in the clinical field may be at an unfortunate disadvantage further patient data collection can be complex including technological and ethical dimension due to the need to engage with a vulnerable population and gather sensitive largely nonpublic information that might include hipaa protected data open source hipaa compliant infrastructure with customizable data collection functionality can be helpful to overcome some of these technical challenge participatory research effort such a the connected and open research ethic core initiative can be used to develop dynamic and relevant ethical practice to guide and navigate the social and ethical complexity of patient data collection initiative focusing on voluntary data donation approach such a the notable ourdatahelps program for suicide prevention research can be utilized to gather high quality data about people clinical mental health state alongside their social medium data harnessingpartnerships betweencomputationalandclinical researcher and patient finally this research area can benefit extensively from crossdisciplinary partnership collecting patient data for building the predictivemodelsinvolves human cost and suffers from resource and logistical constraint in working with sensitive population such a patient with mental illness it is important to have appropriate clinical risk management protocol in place especially when the source of data concern social medium activity of patient monitored in a near realtime fashion computational researcher by themselves may not be best equipped to define or implement such protocol moreover clinical expertise is needed to identify and navigate the right way and the right time to approach patient for informed consent regarding data sharing and ass how it would impact their perception of clinical care partnership of computational researcher and clinician throughout the research pipelineeg right from establishing validity of measured online behavior providing appraisal of the data via qualitative coding task to interpreting and situating large scale data analysis can also improve rigor and eliminate issue of construct validity and improve theoretical grounding of the approach moreover directly incorporating patient feedback in the construction and acquisition of the clinical diagnostic signal will not only help represent their voice in the functioning of the predictive model and engage them a partner in treatment but also support advancing the vision of participatory mental

improvement over cnn with a minor improvement of fm for rnnav fm for rnnmax and the highest improvement of fm for rnnatt thus we believe that considering the sequential characteristic of text a done by rnn model can be beneficial for analyzing post related to mental health we should also note the improvement due to the attention mechanism a compared to the maximum and averaging strategy on average fm those result are consistent with the result presented by yang et al for other type of text eg review and other type of label eg rating a for per class performance rnnatt improves this performance by fm on average the improvement in precision is twice a low a the improvement in recall relative change in pr v in rc this difference is particularly remarkable for more rare class we tend to attribute this to intrinsic property of rnns see table a relatively high performance improvement of fm is observed for the class of post bpd bipolar schizophrenia selfharm addiction cripplingalcoholism opiate autism which are under represented on average represent of all the test set post and with a relatively low document length sentence on average v sentence for all the class except for intrinsic property of rnns our modeling approximation we limit the document size to sentence to avoid optimization issue could also contribute to this improvement a can be seen from the confusion matrix in figure the intrinsic overlap of post content across the theme can be misleading for classification eg and again a shown by gkotsis et al a lot of opiate post are misclassified a cripplingalcoholism and vice versa however hierrnn is in general more precise and reveals le confusion between class eg the amount of confusion for schizophrenia with depression ha reduced twice a compared to cnn one of the advantage of the attention mechanism is that it weight can be visualized and interpreted by human which is not always the case with neural network layer in this work we focus on the analysis of sentencelevel attention weight this information can be especially helpful for reducing the quantity of analyzed post sentence to create le costly classification solution table provides result of our analysis of attention weight distribution for this analysis we filtered out onesentence document we study how often an absolute sentence position receives a maximum or a minimum weight from the total amount of case this position is present across document a document is long enough we report top three maximum and minimum position we also report average entropy value for the distribution per sentence we also report similar statistic for a selection of class in table our analysis show that rnnatt is able to distinguish a certain semantic importance pattern the most attention is paid to the first then to the second and finally last sentence the least attention is systematically paid to a sentence after a peak attention at the beginning th sentence to a sentence in the middle th position and to a sentence before the end th position at the same time attention weight are quite equally spread between peak position average entropy of the entropy value tend to increase for the class that are better represented and for which post are on average longer eg depression suicidewatch relevant information is not concentrated in those longer document and several sentence are likely to be equally important table provides some example of attention distribution for document of different length and belonging to different class so that for a longer document from suicidewatch the most relevance is given to the first sentence containing word like rejection and depression whereas a neutral sentence i met this girl receives a low weight for a short document of sentence from cripplingalcoholism of the weight is concentrated on the st sentence this sentence is especially relevant to the topic and contains keywords such a beer and sober note that for instance for a schizophrenia post a class for which performance wa significantly improved by fm a compared to cnn the elaboration of the topic of auditory hallucination in the first two sentence might have been taken into account by rnns however rnns usually require more computational power to be trained than other neural architecture we believe that such information on attention distribution can be

Hitzler",11,0,0,0,2020,depression is a highly prevalent public health concern and a major cause of disability worldwide depression affect ie about million american each year according to the world mental health survey conducted in country about of people reported having at least one depressive episode in untreated or undertreated depressive symptom can lead to suicide and other chronic and risky behavior such a drug or alcohol addiction more than of people who commit suicide have a preexisting diagnosis of depression global effort to curb depression involve identifying depressive symptom through surveybased method employing online questionnaire these approach suffer from underrepresentation a well a sampling bias survey data also exhibit problem due to temporal gap between the data collection and dissemination of finding recent year have witnessed rapid growth in the analysis of social medium for studying a wide range of health problem from detecting the influenza epidemic and cardiac arrest to studying mood and mental health condition the widespread adoption of social medium where people voluntarily and publicly express their thought mood emotion and feeling and share their daily struggle with mental health ha not been adequately tapped into studying mental illness such a depression insight gleaned from social medium such a twitter can be complementary to the current surveybased method that can assist both governmental and nongovernmental organization in policy development the visual and textual content shared on different social medium platform like twitter offer new opportunity for a deeper understanding of selfexpressed depression both at an individual and communitylevel for instance the news headline twitter fail teen sent tweet before committing suicide no one helped highlight the need for better tool for gleaning useful insight from user generated content on social medium platform that can assist policy designer in providing resource for individual with depressive symptom recent analysis have lead to datadriven discovery alongside the traditional hypothesistesting social science process they have suggested that language style sentiment user activity and engagement expressed in social medium post can predict the likelihood of depression these study often use psycholinguistic analysis supervised and unsupervised language modeling and expressed topic of interest however except for a few attempt these investigation have seldom studied extraction of emotional state from the visual content of posted image and profile image visual content can express user emotion more vividly and psychologist have noted that imagery is an effective medium for communicating difficult emotion according to emarketer photo accounted for of content posted on facebook worldwide and are the most engaging type of content indeed a picture is worth a thousand word and now photo are worth a million like similarly on twitter the tweet with image link get twice a much attention a those without and videolinked tweet drive up engagement the ease and naturalness of expression through visual imagery can serve to glean depressive symptom in vulnerable individual who often seek social support through social medium further a psychologist carl rogers highlight we often pursue and promote our idealself in this regard the choice of profile image can be a proxy for one online persona providing a window into an individual mental health status for instance choosing a profile image with the emaciated leg of an individual with several cut portrays negative selfview moreover psychologist have argued that people use picture to communicate message in social medium post which represent our ideal self or who we want to be indeed we are constantly motivated to pursue behavior that bring u closer to our ideal self inferring demographic information like gender and age can be crucial for stratifying our understanding of populationlevel epidemiology of mental health disorder relying on electronic health record data previous study have explored gender difference in depressive behavior from different angle including prevalence age of onset comorbidities a well a biological and psychosocial factor for instance woman have been diagnosed with depression twice a often a men and a national psychiatric morbidity survey in the uk ha shown a higher risk of depression in woman on the other hand suicide rate for men are three to five time higher compared to woman woman are more likely to socialize and express their dysphoria while men tend to express their anger and show negative behavior such a alcohol abuse and drug dependency although depression can affect anyone at any age the sign and risk factor for depression vary for different age group depression trigger for child include domestic violence and loss of a pet or family member for adolescent depression may arise from hormonal imbalance latelife depression ha caused the suicide rate in people aged to to be more than twice that of the general population depression in the elderly population often occurs with other medical condition that persist which can increase the risk of death therefore inferring demographic information while studying depressive behavior from passively sensed social data can shed better light on the populationlevel epidemiology of depression the recent advancement in deep neural network specifically for image analysis task can lead to detecting demographic feature such a age and gender we aim to show that by determining and integrating a heterogeneous set of feature from different modalitiesaesthetic feature from posted image colorfulness hue variance sharpness brightness blurriness naturalness choice of profile picture for gender age and facial expression screen name language feature from both textual content and profile description ngram emotion sentiment sociability from egonetwork and user engagementwe can identify individual who are more likely to be depressed from a data set of humanannotated twitter user we address the following research question how well doe the content of posted image color aesthetic and facial presentation reflect depressive symptom doe the choice of profile picture show any psychological trait corresponding to a depressed online persona are profile picture reliable enough to represent demographic information such a age and gender and can they be used for communitylevel management of depression are there any underlying theme among depressed individual generated using multimodal content that can be used to reliably detect depression our contribution include analysis of the content of posted image in term of color aesthetic facial presentation and their association with depressive symptom uncovering the underlying relationship between visual and contextual content of likely depressed profile obtained using a demographic

prediction model the predictive model were linear regression model that predicted user mental status using osns dynamic feature in this study dynamic feature is a term that is relative to static feature which refers to those feature having notable change over time eg per day l li li hao guan zhu in other word the value of these dynamic feature is expected to be different at any given point we downloaded the weibo user data using the application programming interface api provided by sina weibo httpweibocom for each user we extracted dynamic feature from two perspective linguistic inquiry and word count liwc feature see gao hao li gao and zhu and zhao jiao bai and zhu for more detail and behavioral feature liwc is a widely used natural language processing tool mapping psychological and linguistic dimension of written expression it report the degree of language usage in dimension eg positive emotion word family word etc we calculated the liwc feature using the chinese version of the text analysis software textmind gao et al textmind divide a post into several word piece eg i experienced dv to i experienced dv it then calculates the frequency of word piece of each dimension during the last step textmind output the ratio of the summarized frequency of each dimension to the total number of word a liwc feature in addition to liwc feature we also extracted behavioral feature count of word count of word per sentence count of url count of name count of tag count of post count of original post count of comment count of positive emotion emoji use count of negative emotion emoji use and count of neutral emotion emoji use when a user posted on weibo or updated his or her online profile his or her online data changed and the value of dynamic feature correspondingly wa altered based on the record of user online behavior in our study some user did not update their weibo every day eg updating their profile sending new post replying to others post thus our prediction model were built based on weekly feature extraction rather than that daily for each week during the research period week before dv and week after dv we extracted behavioral feature and liwc feature that is feature for each user per week according to previous study the prediction model produced the best prediction result when generated by the mean value of the previous week hu we then took the mean value of feature across week a the input dynamic feature of each user and fed them into the prediction model figure portrays the procedure from data extraction to mental status prediction the model therein make use of various machinelearning algorithm to establish mapping from dynamic feature to related questionnaire score all the prediction model have reached a moderate correlation with questionnaire score predictive model of depression we applied the prediction model to predict the degree of depression this prediction model wa developed by hu where they invited weibo user to complete the item

russo dee lamb greenbaum higher rate of suicide risk among witness of dv in the present study wa consistent with kitzmann gaylord holt and kennys finding where exposure to dv and mental health problem were strongly linked our finding identified the shortterm effect of dv on mental health and we also provided evidence for their difference among three type of dv including child abuse ipv and exposure to dv sample from previous study were dv victim recruited from shelter or refuge house who actively seeking help r campbell sullivan davidson krishnan et al preztestor castillo davins salamero sanmartino existing finding regarding the effect of dv on mental health were also based on collection of victim from subsamples of longitudinal study where very few participant reported their unpredictable dv experience brown cohen johnson smailes hayatbakhsh et al in this study we proposed an alternative sampling method based on the publically available online record of their post compared with previous work we recruited a potential dv victim population through their posting about their dv experience through their social medium message however this also ha it own set of limitation the reliability of the reported dv experience from the collected online user is one limitation of this study our analysis relied on weibo user message and we assumed their selfreported dv experience wa accurate to overcome this limitation we manually checked all the collected post and user profile a one of the most popular osns weibo is an emerging data collection platform for social science and human behavior research our sample had the limitation of only including a population more likely than the general public to use social medium and specifically post their dv experience publically thus our study finding did not represent the entire dv victim population however although not everyone us osns and not every osn user prefers this kind of exposure the online sampling and measurement could still offer a unique sample that could be larger more updated timely and costbeneficial than survey method we were able to identify the victim with relatively mild dv experience in addition to those who actively sought help due to continual and severe dv sufferance our result indicated that the consequence of dv on mental health could be identified from publicly available social medium data thus our study informs the development of online assessment for dv victim through analyzing their social medium message in addition the work presented here call for future study to develop online social medium tool for detecting social medium user who search for help through posting dv experience herein we put forth a new approach to investigate individual mental health a well a other psychological feature today large machinelearning model have been built to predict an individual psychological profile from osn data eg hao et al qiu et al zhang et al these algorithm provide a superb opportunity for psychologist to measure which could not be measured before for example with the help of predictive model youyou et al were able to eliminate the reference effect in personality similarity measurement this study showed that it wa able to conduct the beforeafter mental health measurement perfectly matched the timing of dv incidence more potential for oer in psychological study can be explored in the future predicting user psychological trait can be beneficial for scientific exploration and monitoring victim mental health status however the improper use of prediction result may pose a threat to an individual wellbeing freedom or life no matter whether they are correct or not kosinski stillwell graepel to control the balance between the promise and peril of oer study extreme caution is necessary to protect victim privacy we only use public data in this study and the post were anonymized during processing so that the user identity could not be paired with their mental health status there are several additional limitation in our study that merit attention first owing to the limited information available from weibo post and user profile there is the possibility that the user information on weibo wa not consistent with their actual condition which refers to fake profile and false report for example the user may hide prior dv experience on purpose to cope with this limitation we utilized rigorous inclusion criterion to ensure that our result were reliable based on the user online report second there wa unavoidable subjectivity when judging the post even with careful consensus by three different judge and detailed criterion third we did not further analyze the demographic information a confounding variable a certain user did not provide complete demographic information on their weibo profile especially for age information in future study the online method can be combined with offline survey to further enhance the authenticity and completeness of data fourth most of the dv victim in this study were victim of physical violence physical violence n nonphysical violence n the sample were biased probably because physical violence is more straightforward to perceive and easier to articulate compared with other type of abuse thus our result suggest more of the effect of dv on physical violence victim fifth our study only engages in exposure to one single type of violence it is reported that child with dual exposure of dv eg physical violence and sexual violence may encounter increased vulnerability in mental health compared with those with exposure to a single type of dv moylan et al doseresponse relationship exist between cumulative type of victimization ouelletmorin et al future study could explore more about it through online data finally although the statistical result based on oerpredicted value could lead to new knowledge we should be more careful when applying the prediction model to individual or small sample that require heightened accuracy such a assisting in diagnosis within clinical practice despite these limitation our study ha made several important contribution we have demonstrated a case using oer to overcome the restriction of traditional measurement method in this case we provided reliable evidence on dvs shortterm impact on several aspect of mental health with the beforeafter measurement perfectly matching the timing of dv incident the oer approach in our study wa regarded a having much potential for future exploration of mental health and violence it is also hopeful that oer will

sensitive stigmatized mental illness to such an invisible or even imagined audience can seem puzzling however the prevalence of the phenomenon a shown in prior work de choudhury et al ernala et al suggests that the discloser might gain certain social benefit from such an audience how can we better understand these audience the way they engage with stigmatized content and the manner they impact the disclosure process on an otherwise general purpose social medium platform addressing these question will help u understand the social benefit a discloser derives over time by continuing to disclose to this audience building on this motivation we present a quantitative methodology to understand audience and their engagement to stigmatized selfdisclosures on twitter we choose the specific case of selfdisclosures of schizophrenia a it is one of the most stigmatized mental health condition and sufferer are known to face negative stereotyping and attitude discriminatory and offensive behavior and societal rejection dickerson et al specifically we focus on the following two research question rq what are the pattern in which social medium audience are engaging with the selfdisclosing individual rq how doe the audience engagement impact the future disclosure process in other word is audience engagement predictive to future intimacy of disclosure towards these research question employing machine learning technique on a clinically validated dataset we obtain a list of individual disclosers who have publicly shared about their diagnosis of schizophrenia on twitter we define the audience of these disclosure a individual who have interacted with the disclosers content using the twitter functionality of retweets favorite or mention then we characterize the temporal variation in audience engagement and study it alignment with respect to what the disclosers present about themselves in their posting rq then drawing from the social penetration theory altman and taylor we model the disclosers behavior by operationalizing the notion of intimacy of disclosure with this measure of intimacy and time series forecasting technique we ass if the engagement received from the audience is predictive of future intimacy of the disclosure made by the disclosers rq based on our characterization of audience engagement we find evidence of temporal and topical reciprocity in the interaction between the disclosers and their audience a would be anticipated in an online support community in relation to the disclosers data the audience engagement includes major theme such a mental health resource stigma and emotional support our result from the time series forecasting model show that attribute of the audience engagement like number of mention received theme

we present result from the thematic annotation on audience engagement content and discus them in the context of the theme derived from disclosers data ref table this juxtaposition of theme help u understand the audience response with respect to what the disclosers are sharing on twitter first among the engagement content theme that relate to experience of schizophrenia we begin by considering the theme mental health supportstigma mhss that also surface in the disclosers data for instance we notice the usage of word such a hcsmca pndhour awareness issue referring to online community dedicated to exchange around health care mental illness and spreading awareness the same theme also includes overlapping word like depression anxiety med mental health pain relating to the stigma and challenge around experience of schizophrenia this show that the audience in response to the schizophrenia content of the disclosers share their experience and resource related to mental health care providing solidarity next we consider another common schizophrenia related theme functioning we observe overlapping keywords such a people life good work money job love sleep relatedly we also find the theme appearance word hair wear red clothes arm softly that surface in the tweet of both the disclosers and their audience taken together these theme relate to the everyday experience capturing behavior around the social emotional physical and cognitive aspect of life their cooccurrence a theme reflects the utility of engagement content a a mechanism to converse about everyday aspect of life communicate plan and exchange thought and idea next we consider the theme emotion that appears in the engagement content with word like love happy good hope lovely miss sweet beautiful while this theme is also present in disclosers data we note a higher prevalence of emotional content in the engagement content than that of the disclosers based on the number of topic contributing towards the theme this particular imbalanced overlap characterizes the emotional support provisioning nature of the engagement that the disclosers gather from their audience a form of support found in the literature to be key to improved mental health state and in supporting therapeutic outcome from disclosure of stigmatized condition de choudhury et al lastly we find an overlap between the audience and the disclosers in the theme sexuality containing term such a girl man guy he shes cute fuck sex this indicates a tendency of the disclosers and in response their audience to open up about deeply personal aspect of their private life that are usually not revealed publicly nevertheless despite the thematic reciprocity noted above we note a sharp distinction between the tweet of the disclosers and audienceshown by the theme symptom in the case of the disclosers this theme rparanormal rcreepy ufo reveals a predominant occurrence of word that have symptomatic relevance to schizophrenia we do not observe such pattern in the theme extracted from the audience engagement content this indicates that although the disclosers are sharing their first person experience of the illness the audience do not respond with similar personal account this brings to light the distinction in broadcasting disclosure on platform like twitter where unlike support community the audience need not necessarily consist of peer undergoing similar experience by juxtaposing the thematic annotation from the disclosers and their audience we find evidence of reciprocal conversation around shared theme related to experience of schizophrenia we situate this discussion in the social penetration theory that give a distinctive emphasis to selfdisclosing behavior being maintained by the gradual overlapping and exploration of their mutual self by party to a relationship sprecher et al pattern of change in the engagement content here we are interested in the questionhow do the above schizophrenia related and other theme from the disclosers and the audience covary over time inspecting figure ad we observe that there is a close temporal alignment between the disclosers and the audience theme relating to schizophrenia experience specifically by analyzing the cross correlation between the two we find that the highest correlation of between the two time series occurs at a negative lag of this positive correlation at a negative lag provides indication of reciprocity in the disclosure processas the disclosers increasingly talk about their schizophrenia experience at time t in day it correlate with the audience talking about similar theme related to these experience at t reciprocity ha been identified a a major norm in selfdisclosure research jiang bazarova and hancock in contrast we find that a the disclosers increasingly talk about their experience the audience begin limiting post on other unrelated topic in the future maximum correlation of at a negative lag of pattern of change in the engagement marker we ask the questionhow doe the audience with the help of various platform functionality respond to disclosers and how do different engagement marker covary with disclosers theme figure a show the zscore distribution of these marker over time we observe two finding first beginning at the day of disclosure there is a peak in mention indicating an increase in incoming engagement from the audience however there is lowered audience engagement during this early period through retweets and favorite this could indicate that the audience find the disclosers content out of place and take time to modulate their engagement around it second there is a very close alignment between the temporal variation in retweets and favorite received from the audience this may be attributable to the similar functionality between both action ie they both indicate some form of acknowledgement or endorsement and have a lower barrier for content production at the click of a button compared to mention which have a higher barrier to content production requiring consciously drafted reply next in figure ej we present an analysis of the temporal variation in the three engagement marker in relation to the disclosers themesboth the schizophrenia related one a well a the rest upon visual inspection we notice that the alignment between the daily measurement of engagement marker is higher with disclosers data related to schizophrenia experience a compared to other unrelated content for the time series representing thematic variation in schizophrenia related experience the maximum correlation with retweets and favorite is observed at cross correlation lag of respectively the negative correlation at a positive lag denotes that a the disclosers increasingly talk about their condition and experience it correlate to receiving fewer retweets and favorite in the day following this is likely explained by the perception that the action of retweet or favorite signal information sharing intention and do not convey an appropriate response to stigmatized disclosure on the other hand we observe a stronger alignment between the disclosure content related to experience of schizophrenia and the mention received the correlation of disclosure related content with mention is the strongest with a lag with a positive value of this show that a the disclosers increasingly talk about their experience it correlate to receiving more mention on the same day however in the case of unrelated theme we observe a delayed response via mention from the audience maximum correlation of at lag summarily our finding from rq suggest reciprocity temporally in the number of engagement marker received and topically in the theme received vizaviz the audience engagement

investigate whether the audience engagement a characterized by engagement marker and engagement content rq can predict future intimacy of disclosure to begin we describe how we operationalize intimacy of disclosure and then propose and evaluate a time series forecasting model to predict these value accurately from the engagement marker and content operationalizing intimacy of disclosure to operationalize the disclosure process we refer to the social penetration theory that model selfdisclosure a a process of building intimate interpersonal relationship we adopt one of the measure proposed by the theory ie depth of disclosure or intimacy to operationalize disclosure in our work the depth of disclosure relates to the degree of intimacy ie how open or close someone can become with another person despite their anxiety over selfdisclosure in the context of mental health related selfdisclosures on twitter depth of disclosure would denote the extent to which the discloser continues to share information about their experience specific to their stigmatizing condition given the lack of availability of ground truth data on disclosure intimacy and because discrete human judgment from a specific post may not be applicable across all user to measure intimacy of disclosure from the textual content of disclosers tweet we use the following hybrid approach leveraging topic modeling and human annotation chancellor et al i manual annotation of disclosers topic adopting the result from topic model built over disclosers data a a thematic representation of their content rq we employed three human raters to analyze the top contributing keywords per topic and then label the level of intimacy disclosed via the topic we defined the level of intimacy to span a threepoint likert scalelow medium and high motivated by prior work taylor and altman first the raters manually browsed a sample of tweet by the disclosers to familiarize themselves with the content then corresponding to this rating scale they created a set of rule to annotate each topic with one of the three level high intimacy of disclosure score of this included topic specific to the experience of schizophrenia information that is rarely expressed on a public social medium platform like twitter for example topic around symptomatic expression social support and stigma related to mental illness were included in this category medium intimacy of disclosure score of this category included behavioral expression related to functioning so cial interaction temporal planning that were not unusual to be shared on twitter low intimacy of disclosure score of this included topic that were totally unrelated to the disclosure of schizophrenia and consisted casual social medium conversation such a political issue entertainment etc following the manual annotation task the raters had a high interrater reliability of given by the fleiss measure out of the topic belonging to disclosers data this annotation task yielded topic with high intimacy with medium and with low intimacy score ii calculating tweetlevel and time series measure of intimacy of disclosure given a tweet posted by the discloser it posterior topic distribution given by the topic model in rq and the intimacy label in rq we calculate the intimacy of the tweet a a weighted sum of all topic probability by their intimacy label to obtain a single score of intimacy of disclosure we aggregate these tweetlevel intimacy value per day and per discloser throughout our analysis period we use zscores of these aggregated value to capture their relative variation over time predicting future intimacy of disclosure from audience engagement given the intimacy of disclosure expressed by the disclosers and the associated engagement marker and content of the audience over time we describe the prediction task a a time series forecasting problem since historical value of intimacy can also assist in predicting future intimacy value we adopt an autoregressive time series forecasting model the dependent or response variable that is being forecasted is the time series representing daily measurement of intimacy of disclosure obtained above the exogenous variable or predictor are the engagement marker received from the audience a characterized by the following time seriesnumber of retweets favorite mention and theme distribution of engagement content note that all timeseries are expressed a zscores of average daily measurement of the variable data preparation first we process the data to verify stationarity assumption of time series forecasting method we execute the following step we apply a moving average transformation with a window size of day to check for change in the mean and variance over time we apply the augmented dickey fuller adf test a standard test for stationarity in a series dickey and fuller for the series that do not pas the adf test we apply a first order shift in the data and reevaluate condition for stationarity model fitting we propose an auto regressive integrated moving average with exogenous input arimax model to predict the dependent variable future intimacy from the exogenous variable audience engagement data our model is meant to forecast on day t the intimacy of disclosure based on the exogenous variable spanning n day before t we perform grid search over a

intimacy of disclosure combined across all disclosers data we observe a peak representing heightened level of intimacy of disclosure on the day of disclosure d and the immediately succeeding day since topic related to the experience of schizophrenia were rated with an intimacy score of it appears that the short period immediately following the day of disclosure continues to include high intimacy content with this time series of intimacy of disclosure a our response variable we proceed to result on the forecasting model first on testing the stationarity assumption we find that the intimacy series despite showing minimal change in mean and variance over time failed to pas the adf test for stationarity t p therefore we performed first order shift differencing on this series and reevaluated for stationarity by the adf test if yt denotes the value of the time series y at period t then the first difference of y at period t is equal to yt yt we find that the differenced series for intimacy successfully pass the adf test t p following the same approach we evaluate stationarity of all the exogenous variable ie engagement marker and content theme we find that all the series pas the stationarity test except for the engagement content series specifically the following themesmental health supportstigma sexuality communication and temporal reference we applied the same differencing technique and note that the stationarity assumption are met next based on the grid search result for model selection and parameter tuning we found the best lag order for the arimax process ie the autoregressive and moving average parameter to be p and q including the differencing parameter d we fit an arimax model on the time series data intimacy of disclosure engagement marker and content for forecasting the goodness of fit of this model in term of loglikelihood aic and bic were found to be and respectively table summarizes the arimax model in term of point mass estimate of the external variable their confidence interval and the corresponding pvalues we refer to this information to examine the variable that provide the most explanatory power in the forecasting problem iewe ask what engagement marker and engagement content shared by the audience have high predictive power in forecasting future intimacy level of the disclosers we ass statistical significance here at the p level first we observe that the number of mention received is a significant predictor of future intimacy this affirms our previous finding that mention indicate a strong incoming engagement in way of conversing sharing experience and resource with the disclosers next we find two theme within the audience engagement content that are statistically significant to future intimacy level the first such theme is emotion with keywords such a care worry trust life emotional support received in case of stigmatized condition ha been shown to help with coping and provide satisfaction in online support community by previous study vlahovic et al prior work ha also linked intimacy to satisfaction with social support received during crisis hobfoll nadler and leiberman this relates with our finding that emotional content received through audience engagement can be linked to intimacy and predict future disclosure behavior the second significant theme is sexuality discussion on one sexuality are often considered to be sensitive in nature when they happen on a public social medium platform like twitter they indicate the audience intent to reciprocally converse with the disclosers about topic that are otherwise personal this reciprocity might also motivate the disclosers to reveal more intimate aspect of their illness experience to their audience finally to validate the model we compute insample rolling prediction for the model on an outofsample data over the last day in our yearlong period of analysis note that the arimax model forecast the differenced intimacy of disclosure and therefore the predicted value are compared to the original differenced value of intimacy ref figure c we observe that our model is able to closely forecast the actual intimacy level of disclosure assessing model performance we find the root mean square error mean absolute error and symmetric mean absolute percentage error measure a and respectively these value statistically establish the satisfactory performance of the model a a final validation step we check the residual of the model for absence of serial correlation we compute the durbinwatson statistic which test for

social medium de choudhury schwartz et al a de choudhury et al while many user discus physical health condition such a cancer or the flu paul and dredze dredze aramaki et al hawn some also discus mental illness there are a variety of motivation for user to share this information on social medium to offer or seek support to fight the stigma of mental illness or perhaps to offer an explanation for certain behavior past mental health work ha largely focused on depression with some considering posttraumatic stress disorder coppersmith et al b suicide tong et al jashinsky et al seasonal affective disorder and bipolar disorder coppersmith et al a while these represent some of the most common mental disorder it only begin to consider the range of mental health condition for which social medium could be utilized yet obtaining data for many condition can be difficult a previous technique required the identification of affected individual using traditional screening method de choudhury schwartz et al b coppersmith et al a proposed a novel way of obtaining mental health related twitter data using the selfidentification technique of beller et al they looked for statement such a i wa diagnosed with depression automatically uncovering a large number of user with mental health condition they demonstrated success at both surveillance and analysis of four mental health condition while a promising first step the technique efficacy for a larger range of disorder remained untested in this paper we employ the technique of coppersmith et al a to amass a large diverse collection of social medium and associated label of diagnosed mental health condition we consider the broadest range of condition to date many significantly le prevalent than the disorder examined previously this test the capacity of our approach to scale to many mental health condition a well a it capability to analyze relationship between condition in total we present result for ten condition including the four considered by coppersmith et al a to demonstrate the presence of quantifiable signal for each condition we build machine learning classifier capable of separating user with each condition from control user furthermore we extend previous analysis by considering approximate age and gendermatched control in contrast to the randomly selected control in most past study do real and culotta found demographic control an important baseline a they muted the strength of the measured outcome in social medium compared to a random control group using demographicallymatched control allows u to clarify the analysis in condition where age is a factor eg people with ptsd tend to be older than the average user on twitter using the ten condition and control group we characterize a broad range of difference between the group we examine difference in usage pattern of category from the linguistic inquiry word count liwc a widely used psychometrically validated tool for psychologyrelated analysis of language pennebaker et al pennebaker et al depression is the only condition for which considerable previous work on social medium exists for comparison and we largely replicate those previous result finally we examine relationship between the language used by people with various condition a task for which comparable data ha never before been available by considering multiple condition we can measure similarity and difference of language usage between condition rather than just between a condition and the general population the paper is structured a follows we begin with a description of how we gathered and curated the data then present an analysis of the data coherence and the quantifiable signal we can extract from it including a broad survey

individual who are distressed by affective and behavioral challenge these tool act a a constantly available and conducive source of information advice and support an important motivation behind the use of these online resource for mental health concern is also that they support open and honest discourse selfdisclosure can be an important therapeutic ingredient and is linked to improved physical and psychological wellbeing the nature of online mental health discourse however may vary depending on the nature of identity adopted by an individual this is likely to be particularly valid in the case of mental illness since it is considered socially stigmatic literature in sociology also support this observation in his celebrated book stigma goffman examined how individual with a socially discredited attribute such a mental illness tend to manage impression of themselves in social settingsin order to protect their identity however we note that in online setting such a on social medium this constraint may be circumvented this is because individual may choose to withhold their actual identity allowing themselves to engage in more candid selfdisclosure than is possible in offline setting or through their identified online persona our motivation for this research is also rooted in the rich literature on online identity construction which ha been recognized a a key aspect of online community prior work demonstrates dissociative anonymity a resistance to attach to offline identity or to their actual accountonline persona for instance can be the foundation of online disinhibition online disinhibition the ability to avoid being visible verifiable and accountable lead people to act differently than they would in offline setting social medium naturally provides u with a rich ecosystem where we can study way in which individual manage their identity to engage in discourse on a stigmatized condition like mental illness in this light this paper focus on a relatively underexplored area of research involving characterization of behavior around a stigmatized condition mental illness in doing so we extend our own prior work on examining mental health support on social medium here we investigate identity management in social medium in the context of mental health specifically we focus on the social medium reddit which in contrast to other popular social medium and networking platform like facebook and twitter provision adoption of throwaway account a semianonymous identity for posting content throwaway are temporary account that reddit user create to dissociate from their primary reddit identity most throwaway account are used exactly once thus their use disallows user behavior to be tracked historically or through posting made from primary reddit account note that throwaway however do not adhere to a strict notion of anonymity but research ha shown that they are often used a proxy of anonymity we leverage this observation about throwaway account in our study our primary contribution lie in characterizing how different form of identity on mental health subreddits are associated with distinctive affective cognitive linguistic style and social attribute leveraging measure derived from literature in psychology which suggest language to be a reliable way of measuring people internal thought and emotion we also study the difference in the nature of content shared in throwaway post and post from regular reddit account on these subreddits our finding based on a large corpus of reddit post indicate the presence of almost six time more throwaway post in mental health subreddits in contrast to other subreddits thus throwaway may be fulfilling a unique need for individual seeking to use reddit for discourse around a stigmatic health concern moreover we observe that throwaway posting in mental health forum exhibit increased negativity greater cognitive bias and selfattentional focus lowered selfesteem and greater disinhibition even to the extent of revealing vulnerability to selfharm through these finding throwaway are observed to allow individual to be le inhibited by selfpresentation concern presumably due to lack of identifiability and accountability our work on one hand indicates the potential of using social medium for behavioral therapy community moderator may encourage semianonymous and

https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2740908.2743049,20,7,"De Choudhury, Pavalanathan",2,1,0,0,2015,corresponding to our rq we begin by examining the discerning characteristic of post made from throwaway in mental health mh subreddits compared to those in other subreddits control subreddits a listed in table this will help u validate finding from psycholinguistics literature whether discourse from throwaway account in the mental health subreddits bear language marker known to be associated with psychological challenge such a mental illness we find statistically significant difference between the two group we observe almost time more throwaway post in the mental health subreddits than in control subreddits this could be because of the stigmatic nature of mental illness likely people prefer to post under a semianonymous identity more frequently compared to other more mundane social contextstopics this notable difference in the proportion of throwaway post lead to exploring whether the throwaway post in mental health subreddits differ from the control subreddits we use the measure of social affective cognitive and linguistic process defined earlier for this purpose we present statistical hypothesis testing between the cohort using independent sample ttests affective attribute from table we observe notable differencesthrowaway mh post tend to use more attribute of negative affective process such a negative emotion almost twice of the control group anger almost twice of the control group anxiety and sad more than time a control group prior literature indicates such increased negative affect to be associated with depression symptom such a mental instability and helplessness loneliness and restlessness the following post excerpt illustrate this i know killing myself would hurt my family but so would telling them that im a such a worthless failure this tell u that reddit user find writing throwaway post in the mental health subreddits a a forum to talk about their negative emotion in order to reduce stress and increase positive selfperceptions cognitive attribute throwaway post in mh subreddits use more negation time a control group such a no not never usage of which is associated with inhibition ie mh post from throwaway account are likely more selfconscious than user writing post in control subreddits using throwaway it a never ending cycle therapy is not helping at all and i have tried several therapist i have not seen my dr since being put on the zoloft almost month ago throwaway mh post also use more of feel and insight word which show their expression of feeling further throwaway mh post use more death related word time a control group which indicate their vulnerability to physical harm linguistic style attribute throwaway mh cohort is found to be focused more on the present and the here and now present tense le on the past past tense next lower use of linguistic process term such a family friend home social work human and money imply the throwaway mh redditors are le socially concerned or bothered in fact together with the fact that they also use greater number of first person pronoun show that throwaway post in mental health subreddits contain more personal story and are in general high in selfpreoccupation lower use of second person pronoun first person plural pronoun and third person pronoun in throwaway mh post implies that these redditors tend to be le socially interactive with the larger reddit audience increased use of health word in throwaway mh post reveals that these post talk more about their health related issue social attribute lastly throwaway mh post receive lesser social support ie lower number of comment almost time lower than control group this might be due to the smaller size of the audience in the formermental health related topic form a relatively more niche community compared to a subreddit like askreddit however this cohort doe receive

physical health stigma is recognised a a significant barrier for the early diagnosis and treatment of various mental health condition the world health organisation ha highlighted the significant role of stigma in influencing mental health prognosis and ha identified it reduction a a key target in it action plan stigma is thought to be more prevalent in illness perceived to have uncertain or complex aetiology this may partially explain why stigma towards mental health condition is much higher than it is to physical health problem research by rsch et al support the link between poor knowledge and stigma and showed that increased mental health literacy is associated with a reduction in stigmatising attitude furthermore poor understanding of mental health condition ha been shown to be associated with public fear and the perception that people experiencing mental health problem are dangerous one of the most significant repercussion of stigma is it effect on helpseeking behaviour people with mental health problem are le likely to seek help if they feel their condition is stigmatised stigmatising attitude also isolate sufferer and make many societal role such a finding a job harder trivialisation is a minimising behaviour where an illness is conceptualised a being easier to acquire suffer with or treat it may also be perceived a a form of stigma and ha consequence recent research suggests that trivialisation can arise when diagnosis are introduced into common use without education on their meaning for example using the term ocd to describe a personal preference regarding the arrangement of their belonging eg im ocd about tidying my room this may devalue the experience of those suffering from a mental health condition study exploring the role of trivialisation in society suggest this may reinforce social inequality and this phenomenon is more prevalent in mental health condition stigma and trivialisation are not equally distributed across different mental health condition research ha demonstrated that schizophrenia is one of the most negatively viewed condition due to it misperception of danger and unpredictability similarly study show that eating disorder and depression appear to be stigmatised due to a perception of greater personal controllability stigma is also common in portrayal of physical condition and differs between individual condition a study of primary care attendee found that hiv wa stigmatised significantly more than diabetes and hypertension another study comparing stigma in aid and cancer found that aid wa significantly more stigmatised than cancer due to societal attitude towards homosexuality and religion previous study have assessed stigma using medium portrayal of mental illness they were found to include disproportionately high level of stigmatising reference to dangerousness and violence but these study are limited by low response rate a reliance on survey and traditional medium anchoring effect these issue have prompted the use of alternative approach and attention ha turned to social medium two recent study have used twitter to ass stigmatising attitude towards mental and physical illness reavley and pilkington found tweet containing schizophrenia were significantly more stigmatised than those containing depression joseph et al showed that schizophrenia wa more stigmatised than diabetes on social medium these study were limited by short sampling period and by sampling tweet containing only two specific hashtags it is likely that searching larger phrase and key word may return view people express in conversation and this may be more representative of public opinion a further limitation of both these study is that only one mental and one physical health condition were compared diminishing the opportunity to observe trend both within and between mental and physical health problem in this study we ass the prevalence of both stigmatising and trivialising attitude in a great number of message from a large social medium platform ie twitter we are aiming to contrast attitude within different mental health condition a well a between different mental and physical health

trivialising attitude across physical and mental health condition on social medium the result show that mental health condition were subject to more stigmatising and trivialising attitude than physical health but there wa a large variation in prevalence between condition our finding that schizophrenia and hiv were the most stigmatised condition is consistent with much of the previous research on this topic using different method both condition share a perception of being dangeroushivaids a a highly infectious and poorly understood disease and schizophrenia perceived a unpredictable and difficult to control many tweet used psychotic a an insult and this is likely due to a deeply entrenched culture of negativity surrounding schizophrenia reinforced by medium stereotype the observed trend of stigma generally reflect those seen within the literature but the prevalence appears to be greater compared to previous study whilst this could suggest that our definition of stigma is more sensitive this study wa the first to consider whole tweet rather than just hashtags which may have uncovered stigmatising attitude that had not previously been assessed other strength of this study compared to previous research in this field were the large population size comprehensive tweet collection and the random sampling method which ensured a representative sample of tweet for each target condition by using automated software we could retrieve a larger number of tweet compared to all previous study in this area and we also considered a wider range of target condition our methodology also allowed u to build on previous research and use qualitative analysis to compare tweet theme between mental and physical illness this showed that mental health condition were more likely to be discussed through opinion rather than factual discourse and tweet in the opinion theme were more likely to be stigmatising while physical health condition were more likely to be discussed via informative tweet see fig we think this is notable a it reaffirms the idea that stigma is often driven by misinformed opinion and concerted campaign to increase the informative content in discussion of mental illness on twitter could form the basis for future stigmareduction strategy although this study improves on previous research there were still several limitation the rating process meant there wa an inherent degree of subjectivity due to difference in the perceived context and emotional tone of some tweet and the inability to follow link and embedded picture this wa made particularly evident by word that had dual meaning eg cancer depression there wa also a degree of selection bias a stigmatising and trivialising tweet were more likely to be lacking in context andor grammatical correctness rendering them le likely to be considered for analysis we minimised the impact of these issue through our robust rating criterion and repeated interrater reliability testing a binary rating system wa chosen a it allowed u to rate a larger number of tweet but it may have obscured important difference in the mechanism by which condition are stigmatised and trivialised due to the information available via the api we were unable to control for potential confounding variable such a demographic characteristic the limitation of this study provide several opportunity for refinement in any future study these include a nonbinary approach to rating stigma tweet evaluating retweets perhaps a a proxy of endorsement and analysis of the profile that generate the tweet eg activity and number of follower it can be difficult to infer context from tweet systematic incorrect inference can lead to either overestimation or underestimation of stigma and trivialisation prevalence study in this area should consider carefully how tweet are rated the difficulty can be illustrated by the following two example the tweet i can seizure salad contains little context and it is not possible to determine whether the user is trivialising the condition or ha simply misspelt caesar while the adjective depressed is often used to infer low mood and the sufferance of clinical depression some tweet were ambiguous eg i have a deep love for depressed comedian and therefore had to be excluded from character or le it can be difficult to unambiguously infer meaning we have shown that stigma and trivialisation are highly prevalent on social medium and that a an evergreater proportion of social interaction take place online proactive campaign should consider assessing and addressing both on social medium platform we believe our study can contribute to develop the knowledge necessary to build computer algorithm capable of detecting stigma on social medium and give u the opportunity to target antistigma campaign to those who may benefit from it most this is the same logic used by commercial advertising where product advertising is targeted to potential consumer preference inferred by the way they use social medium targeting antistigma campaign to individual profile may prove useful to educate and change attitude towards mental health

difference pvalue in partofspeech usage between depressed and nondepressed individual in this content partofspeech in figure we present the usage of content word for the two class from the erisk dataset individual diagnosed with depression tend to use fewer common and proper noun in comparison with control user they also use more verb and adverb in their post the discourse is focused around action but with fewer entity eg noun showing a defective linguistic structure with le interest in the environment eg people object de choudhury et al to further understand these difference we pay a closer look at the frequency of noun and verb in the social medium discourse we compute the keynes score kilgarriff gabrielatos for verb and noun separately in the keynes analysis we compare the frequency of noun and verb from the post written by individual with depression diagnosis target corpus in comparison to the post from control user reference corpus in figure we present the top verb and noun from each corpus ordered by their loglikelihood ratio g dunning rumination is a cognitive process focusing on past and present negative content and resulting in emotional distress sansone and sansone it is present in several mental health disorder eg depression anxiety obsessivecompulsive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder in depression rumination is defined a behaviour and thought that focus one attention on one depressive symptom and on the implication of these symptom nolenhoeksema the rumination a a response to depression focus the person attention on their emotional state and inhibits the action necessary to distract them from their mood in figure when comparing the usage of the three verb tense present past and future between the two group we expected that sign of rumination would be present in our analysis of verb tense with text from depressed user being shifted into the past smirnova et al but this result is not found in this sample of individual anhedonia people suffering from depression reporting lower anticipatory pleasure and thus talking online le about their future plan anhedonia defined a markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activity most of the day nearly every day association et al is a common symptom of depression the higher frequency of cognitive verb eg feel think know in the text written by depressed individual indicates the cognitive impairment and judgement issue specific to depression people with depression have cognitive deficit and bias in the processing of emotional information and they are unable to adaptively regulate their emotion de choudhury and de individual with or without depression may not differ in their initial response to an adverse event still they differ in their ability to recover once they have experienced the negative emotion depressed individual are not able to repair their mood instead they remain in a negative state of mind which is related to increased negative thought selective attention to negative stimulus and greater accessibility of negative recollection joormann in comparison the individual from the control group use more action verb eg vote lead show begin create in addition depressed individual are more passive they have a lower level of general activity consistent with symptom of depressive disorder hopko et al being an online social medium platform similar to forum reddit is organized in subreddits with specific topic it also ha several community dedicated to mental health problem compared to other social medium platform that require realname authentication eg facebook reddit affords user anonymity or pseudoanonymity complete anonymity is almost impossible user providing bit of information with every interaction on the platform eg comment post reddit allows user to create throwaway account to engage temporary without revealing their identity kilgo et al these type of account are used to discus sensitive information or stigmatizing problem de choudhury and de study the mental health discourse on reddit and show that it community allow a high degree of information exchange related to mental health user use reddit to selfdisclose the challenge faced in their daily life or in personal relationship they also seek emotional support or specific information about mental illness diagnosis and treatment their study demonstrates that reddit fill the gap between social medium platform like twitter and facebook and online health forum regarding mental health discourse examining the frequency of noun in the erisk dataset we show in figure that the user with selfreported depression diagnosis use their reddit account to disclose and discus their mental health problem eg depression anxiety therapist or their personal relationship eg friend boyfriend relationship mom dad the process of seeking online support is also shown in the frequency of verb feel talk diagnose help even if the dataset contains control user active in the depression subreddit the majority of control user seem to post on other themed subreddits eg politics bucur and dinu perform a topic modelling analysis and show that text from control user are found

depression bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have the potential to be fatal because of the increased risk of suicide despite the prevalence and gravity of mental disorder our knowledge concerning everyday challenge associated with these condition is relatively limited especially when compared with many physical condition one of the most studied deficit related to everyday challenge for individual suffering from depression bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is language impairment researcher of these mental disorder have long suspected language impairment because of deficit in frontal lobe functioning which control both emotion regulation and language processing language impairment is typically measured through one performance in semantic processing task ie determining semantic relationship between a word phrase or category or differentiating real word from pseudowords based on an individual semantic network and verbal fluency task ie production of word from phonemic or semantic category despite the importance of language in everyday life these study do not illustrate daily challenge associated with language impairment moreover generalizability remains uncertain because of small sample size with inconsistent result regarding language impairment or frontal lobe activity despite it potential for devastating disability it is unclear how language impairment manifest in common form of written communication for example social medium communication with increasing use of technology come increasing opportunity to write for instance in of american adult used the internet and one of the most frequent us of the internet is written communication including communication on social medium nearly twothirds of american adult use social medium roughly a tenfold increase from a decade ago a few social medium platform and online mental health community within reddit for example have become a popular venue for individual suffering from mental disorder reddit support throwaway and unidentifiable account which can protect user from social discrimination surrounding mental disorder and allow honest discussion that may not be appropriate on other social medium site such a facebook reddit also provides contextual information that is relatively limited in other popular social medium platform eg twitter because of length limitation it is also known that effortful task ie requiring attention such a expressing thought via writing are more difficult than automatic task ie not requiring attention for individual suffering from depression and bipolar disorder whereas both type of task are equally difficult for schizophrenia patient from previous study on mental disorder and reddit we can infer that individual suffering from mental disorder also frequently engage in written communication yet the written communication challenge faced by individual in online mental health community remain unknown examining important feature of writing provides an opportunity to ass member written communication skill and any associated linguistic challenge for example a study on writing quality used linguistic feature such a lexical diversity syntactic complexity and word frequency to predict the quality of writing in different study ease of reading ie simple and clear writing and text cohesion with respect to text flow were suggested a some of the most determinant feature of writing quality we can examine these feature to ass online mental health community member written communication challenge more specifically le lexical diversity and poor readability in post can be a sign of language impairment research on language impairment ha linked significantly le lexical diversity with specific language impairment similarly poor sentence structure and difficulty with organization and articulating idea which can be described a insufficient readability were also associated with language impairment readability metric have been longstudied or used in the field of communication education and informatics including social medium writing readability metric provide quantitative estimate of the ease with which reader can comprehend a written text typically they are given a an estimated u grade level by measuring the linguistic characteristic of a given text moreover readability metric although rudimentary consider two of the three aforementioned feature associated with writing quality word frequency and syntactic complexity from the perspective of the writer and their writing quality readability metric can measure the writer ability to present idea simply in a straightforward manner according to one of the developer of the readability metric higher readability score can indicate needle complexity or writing challenge such a organization and articulating idea language impairment can hinder writer ability to simply articulate idea with ease while using a le diverse lexicon moreover one benefit of using these readability metric is that they are computationally simple and relatively straightforward to apply thus we use readability along with lexical diversity ie the third writing quality feature of post a a proxy for written communication challenge among individual suffering from depression bipolar disorder and schizophrenia though mental health and language impairment have been studied extensively le is known about written communication challenge manifested in social medium a well a the effect of longterm participation in online mental health community on written communication challenge among individual suffering from depression bipolar disorder and schizophrenia disorder understanding written communication challenge among these individual ha implication for treating mental disorder managing online mental health community and conducting future research despite the importance in clinical practical and public policy implication for mental health to our knowledge the investigation of written communication challenge utilizing communication in online mental health community ha not been the focus of previous research on mental health we aim to fill this gap in the literature with this study and address two research question rq rq to what extent do written communication challenge manifest in online mental health community focusing on depression bipolar disorder
