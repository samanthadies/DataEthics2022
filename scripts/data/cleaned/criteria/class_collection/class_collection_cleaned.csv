https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025909,1,we now present a methodology of identifying post shared in university subreddits that that are likely to be mental health expression note that our reddit data doe not contain any gold standard information around whether a post shared in a university subreddit is about one mental health experience or condition our proposed method overcomes this challenge by employing an inductive transfer learning approach first we include a ground truth data reddit post made on various mental health support community prior work ha established that in these community individual selfdisclose a variety of mental health challenge explicitly parallelly we utilize another set of reddit post made on generic subreddits unrelated to mental health to be a control next we build a machine learning classifier to distinguish between these two type of post then we learn feature that could detect whether an post shared in a university subreddit could be an expression of some mental health concern we discus these step in detail in the following subsectionswe gained access to a sample of public post from unique user shared between and in a variety of mental health subredditsthis repository of post ha been used in prior work to study mental health selfdisclosure and support seeking manifested in social medium this dataset includes post and associated metadata spanning mental health related subreddits such a rdepression rmentalhealth and rtraumatoolbox rbipolarreddit from this corpus we excluded post that contained only a title without a post body this gave u post we refer to these post a mh post our control data also relied on a dataset compiled and utilized in prior work it contains post from subreddits such a rworldnews rfood and raskreddit we randomly sampled an equal number of post a the mh post above for our control dataset we refer to these post a cl post
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7752434,1,to train our model we require information from two different type of user patient and nonpatients therefore we employed a combined manual effort and keyword matching data collection approach to efficiently collect data for these user for the collection of patient we manually collect the community portal relevant to both mental disorder from these portal follower list we select the selfreported user who explicitly state in their profile description that they suffer from a mental illness ie for a given user we are checking if hisher profile contains any keyword related to a target disorder eg borderline bpd bipolar nonpatients are referred to a random active twitter user who are not explicitly stating that they are suffering from bipolar disorder hereinafter referred to a bd or borderline personality disorder hereinafter referred to a bpd to obtain these user we randomly sampled twitter id thereafter we proceeded to download the tweet from the selected id after the user have been identified we manually label them into one of two category patient a person who is suffering from a mental disorder notrelated any user who we dont consider to be a patient lastly after having obtained the final list of patient we retrieve their tweet these step are applied for the collection of both bpd and bd patient datasets
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68764-y,1,we collected post data from the following six mentalhealthrelated subreddits each of which is reported to be associated with a specific disorder rdepression ranxiety rbipolar rbpd rschizophrenia and rautism in addition we further collected post data from the most popular healthrelated subreddit rmentalhealth to analyze post with general health information from each subreddit we collected all the user id who had at least one post related to the mental health along with user id we also collected title and post using the pushshiftapi note that all the user information is anonymized hence no personally identifiable information wa not included we followed all the anonymization process guided by the sungkyunkwan university institutional review board irb overall the current study collected information from user who wrote post in the seven subreddits from january to december table summarizes the information of collected datawe developed six binary classification model each of which categorizes a user specific post into one of the following subreddits rdepression ranxiety rbipolar rbpd rschizophrenia and rautism our conjecture is that a user who suffers from a specific mental problem writes a post on the corresponding subreddit that deal with the problem a user can write post across multiple subreddits if heshe suffers from multiple mental health problem eg a user suffering from both depression and anxiety however if the model is trained with the post of user who have multiple symptom like a prior study the classification model may suffer from noisy data therefore we developed six independent binary classification model for each symptom to improve the performance by developing six independent model for each mental disorder each of which us data where user suffer from only one particular mental problem we were able to accurately identify a user potential mental state for example to develop a model for detecting depression we labeled the post written by user who upload post only in the rdepression a the depression class the opposite class is referred to a the nondepression class to address a classimbalance issue for the collected data we applied the synthetic minority oversampling technique smote algorithm we divided our dataset into training and testing set then xgboost and convolutional neural network cnn were employed morover we excluded the post of user who wrote post across multiple subreddits in learning phase to quantitatively represent each post we converted the word in the training set to numerical representation fig for the xgboost classifier we used the tfidf vectorizer in the sckitlearn package to convert word into ndimensional vector in the case of the cnn classifier we applied wordembedding procedure from the preprocessed text using the wordvec api of python package gensim the word vector were pretrained with the training dataset collected for the current study with continuous bagofwords representation cbow model while the size of window wa set to five note that by using the pretrained wordvec model for representing each post for each subreddit a language style used by user who write post in a subreddit can be trained for the specific subreddit an overview of the proposed cnnbased model is presented in fig the model architecture is organized by the sequence of layer that includes an embedding layer convolutional layer maxpooling layer dense layer and the output fig illustrates how a post is trained in the given model the first layer of the model is an embedding layer that represents the word embeddings of a preprocessed post with dimension and it weight is initialized by the pretrained wordvec second a convolutional layer with input of word vector ha filter and each filter size is five in addition we applied a dropout rate of to prevent overfitting issue the next layer is a maxpooling layer which take the maximum value within the cnn filter and it dimension is the output of the maxpooling layer is passed through two fully connected dense layer and the final output is the probability of the classification through the sigmoid activation function which range from to for training the neural network we used both the binary crossentropy loss function and adam optimizer with a learning rate of our model wa trained through epoch and the batch size wa set to

of user who publicly mentioned on their twitter profile that they suffer from depression the control dataset wa made up of the timeline of randomly selected twitter user the depressive tweet dataset wa constituted by a manual selection of tweet from the depressive user dataset which specifically included expression indicative of depression in the second step comparison and analysis of the datasets of tweet control depressive user and depressive tweet datasets were carried out to spot their distinguishing feature in the rest of this section we will describe the methodology in detail the flow diagram of the study is depicted in figure the selection of the tweet and their user wa based on the filtered realtime streaming support provided by the twitter api in the first step we selected the user who showed potential sign of depression on twitter on the basis of the most frequent word in spanish expressed by patient suffering from depression in clinical setting these word were jointly identified and selected by a psychologist and a family physician with clinical experience and were based on the definition and general feature of depression according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder the list of word used and their english translation are shown in textbox during june tweet including or more occurrence of the word listed in textbox were collected from this collection of tweet and to select the user who publicly stated in the textual description associated to their profile that they suffered from depression all the profile description including or more occurrence of the word depr and all the possible derivation related to the word depression in spanish such a depre depresin depresivo depresiva deprimido and deprimida were considered from the user who included or more of these word in their description profile user who stated they suffered from depression or were receiving treatment for depression were selected for the analysis this selection wa performed by a psychologist verifying that the statement were related to real expression of depression excluding quote joke or fake one for each of these depressed twitter user we collected all the most recent tweet from their timeline up to a maximum of about tweet thus a total of tweet were collected a figure that wa reduced to after discarding the retweets these tweet constituted the depressive user dataset example of sentence appearing in the user profile that were used for selecting the depressive user are paciente psiquitrico con depresin crnica psychiatric patient with chronic depression example of a profile sentence that indicates depression colecciono errores traducidos a tweet depresivos y a uno que otro impulso de amor i gather error translated into depressing tweet and into one or another love impulse example of a profile sentence that doe not indicate depression once the user with profile sentence indicating depression had been retrieved their twitter timeline were collected only those user having in their timeline at least tweet that suggested sign of depression were retained for further analysis for each user the selection of these tweet wa performed by manually inspecting the tweet of the user complete timeline in reverse temporal order starting from the most recent one to the oldest tweet of the timeline retrieved by mean of the twitter api finally a total number of tweet issued by the depressive user suggesting sign of depression were detected and used for the analysis this set of tweet provided u with the depressive tweet dataset which wa used to analyze linguistic feature of tweet showing sign of depression it ha to be mentioned that these tweet were not to be included in the depressive user dataset see figure at the same time more than tweet were also collected in june such tweet were gathered by listening to the public twitter stream during this time span by only considering tweet with spanish textual content a detected by twitter language identification support given that twitter requires more restrictive filter than just the language of the tweet we used a list of the most frequently used spanish word stopwords to retrieve all tweet that included or more of these word the vast majority of spanish tweet should match this criterion a sample of user who did not mention in their profile the word depression and it derivation were selected randomly from the tweet the complete timeline of these user were compiled tweet which were reduced to once retweets were removed these tweet constituted the control dataset to identify the language of a tweet we relied on the language automatically identified by twitter for each tweet selecting tweet in spanish it ha to be noted that these data can contain some tweet from unidentified depressive user

https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359169,1,selection criterion and data scope to understand the impact of cultural difference on how individual use online mental health platform we begin our analysis by creating a dataset of user from different national community on talklife a support platform with over half a million user for this analysis due to the fact that most research in cscw on mental health online ha been done either agnostic of cultural context or in a western context we choose to focus on user from nonwestern country following zhang et al a researcher located in the global south and with lived experience interacting with the health system and diverse explanatory model of mental illness we believe that moving the focus of cscw and cscwadjacent mental health research away from the west is crucial to better meet the need of people often underserved by the medical system to create these subgroup of user we choose the three nonwestern country with the highest user population on talklife or india malaysia and the philippine guided by the rich amount of literature on the unique nuance to mental health expression for each country we examine the national identity linguistic and behaviorbased difference of use between each user subgroup in particular this research note that a a result of cultural norm around the sharing of distress and alternative conceptualization of mental illness in india malaysia and the philippine symptom are often expressed in somatic and religious term a opposed to traditionally clinical or psychiatric term we choose to analyze each subgroup at the national level for both theoretical and practical reason on a theoretical level in past work in the medical anthropology of mental health national identity ha commonly been used for a approximate level of analysis for cultural identity additionally on a more practical level each user country wa determined using their ip address by talklife and shared with u in an useranonymized dataset inferring a more precise location could potentially compromise user anonymity a discussed in past work and did not seem to have any more significant value for our analysis of cultural difference than analysis at the national level we analyze data from indian user malaysian user and filipino user a shown in table collectively we refer to these country a the minority sample a a comparison set we construct a random sample of all thread on talklife and refer to it a the majority sample due to the relative prevalence of user from western englishspeaking country in talklife most of the thread in the majority sample include post from country such a the usa uk and canada indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on talklife data wa sampled from may to june following this crossnational analysis to see if our broader result on talklife generalize to a differently structured online mental health community we picked the largest western country the united state and the largest nonwestern country india represented on cup a similar support platform with more than user actively using the platform each week using cup data we repeat our analysis testing for the same cultural difference we found in our talklife sample for this analysis we were provided a sample of data on activity from indian user and american user a shown in table unlike our sample of talklife user this dataset is not a random sample there is an upsampling of indian user to ensure that we have data from a sufficient number of indian in the dataset like on talklife indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on cup we focus on indian user due to a lack of sufficient data on user from malaysia or the philippine data wa sampled from march august defining cultural identity and use of clinical language in this work we examine the relationship between cultural identity and use of online mental health support forum to do so we leverage tomlinsons definition of cultural identity a self and communal definition based around specific usually politically inflected differentiation gender sexuality class religion race and ethnicity nationality particularly looking at the aspect that of modern cultural identity that run along national line a delineated by hall et al a a diverse and amorphous form of identity cultural identity can often intersect and interact with other form of identity including religious or ethnic identity however in the absence of direct information about religious or ethnic identity based on the data available we use national identity a a proxy for cultural identity additionally following schlesinger et al call for more intersectional analysis and method within hci we also include analysis of adjacent and intersecting identity when relevant including religious identity to analyze clinical language we use a broader definition of clinical language than just specific medical diagnosis following method used in past work to analyze antidepressant related language we create a dataset of clinical mental health language including unigrams bigram and trigram from a list of mental disorder a defined by the international classification of disease icd and diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder dsm we also included all unigrams from the macmillan dictionary list of word used to describe illness and disease both specifically for mental illness and general illness a a result we include unigrams like night from night terror or sleep from sleep disorder a these are often correlated with specific symptom of mental illness or distress such a sleep issue or being awake at night this included any clinically common abbreviation for mental disorder such a ocd for obsessive compulsive disorder or bpd for borderline personality disorder shorthand for disorder commonly used by online community such a proana a used in proeating disorder community were not included due to the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of these term across disorder we choose to use term from and associated with dsm and icd categorized disorder a a result of the common usage of these framework globally throughout our analysis of these varied factor we use to represent mean and to represent standard deviation constraint limitation and tradeoff cultural identity can exist at many different and intersecting level including subculture and subcommunities within the larger umbrella of a cultural identity a a result for the purpose of this analysis we had to adopt some constraint in order to do a meaningful and specific analysis one large limiting constraint that we chose for this study is to use national identity at the state level a a proxy for cultural identity though a major and formative part of modern cultural identity a argued by both hall and tomlinson each country we analyze is incredibly diverse with many individual cultural identity that both intersect and diverge from a greater national identity a more rich analysis of these other form of cultural identity is beyond the scope of this work but could lead to richer conclusion about the nature of cultural identity in online mental health support community particularly with regard to cultural difference between user with the same national identity additionally to stay consistent between analysis a a result of a lack of data on user from malaysia and the philippine we only analyze user in india on cup and extend these finding to the experience of being part of a minority group on an online mental health forum we draw validity for these exploratory finding from similar consistent pattern we observe between indian malaysian and filipino user but a deeper analysis with a larger dataset is likely necessary to determine when and for which minority community these conclusion do not hold true additionally while we construct clinical language through use of the commonly used dsm and icd both framework of illness categorization have significant limitation particularly in the country we have selected for example there are both mental health disorder that are culturebound a well a mental health language that is used in different way within the specific country we analyze such a depression often being an umbrella term for all mental illness additionally it is clear that online support community often develop their own cultural norm and language around mental health and a deeper understanding of how this play out on talklife and cup is neither the focus nor within the scope of this work in this work we intentionally use standard clinical and medical term for mental health disorder in our analysis of clinical language a detailed in past anthropological research it is theorized that the use of medical and clinical language is representative of a medicalized explanatory model of illness and we frame use of this language across culture a a approximate signifier of a greater awareness of the presence of a mental disorder a opposed to conceptualizing distress a stress tension or depression for our analysis we strictly analyzed post that were in the latin alphabet with almost all post on both talklife and cup being in english however a both malay and tagalog are most commonly written in the latin script and since it is common for user from india speaker to use romanized version of indian language online it is possible that a small minority of post in our analysis were text in a different language however a confirmed by only seeing english word used in our analysis of the top ngrams among each user subgroup it is clear that english is the predominant language on both platform though beyond the immediate scope of this work a greater analysis of nonenglish codeswitching on these platform could lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of interaction on expression between user with the same national identity but different language preference
