https://aclanthology.org/W17-3110.pdf,1,we briefly explain the data collection method here but we refer the interested reader with further question on the methodology to coppersmith et al for the suicide attempt data and coppersmith et al a for all other condition the data for these analysis are twitter post collected via two method most of the data come from user who have publicly discussed their mental health condition these user are frequently referred to a selfstated diagnosis user a they state publicly something like i wa diagnosed with schizophrenia or im so thankful to have survived my suicide attempt last year the data for user with a suicide attempt wa supplemented by data from ourdatahelpsorg a data donation site where people provide access to their public post and fill out a short questionnaire about their mental health history data are then deidentified and made available to researcher addressing question of interest to the mental health community donor provide consent for their data to be used in mental health research upon signup of the user who attempted suicide came from ourdatahelpsorg specifically we examine generalized anxiety disorder eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia and attempted suicide these condition were selected based on the theory that there are important timing aspect to their symptom ebbing and flowing of symptom a treatment is effective especially schizophrenia onset and exacerbation of symptom by external event and stress and punctuated event in time of psychological symptom suicide attempt panic attack and bingingpurging behavior with eating disorder we use the twitter streaming api to collect a sample of user who used a series of mental health word or phrase in their tweet text eg schizophrenia or suicide attempt each tweet that us one of these phrase is examined via regular expression to indicate that the user is talking about themselves finally those tweet that pas the regular expression are examined by a human to confirm to the best of our ability that their selfstatement of diagnosis appears to be genuine this result in a dataset with user that have a selfstated diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder n an eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia or someone who would go on to attempt suicide some of these user do not exhibit the sort of posting behavior required to create micropatterns ie they rarely post multiple time within a hour time window we exclude these user from our analysis which is of user for most condition with the exception of those with a suicide attempt where a little over half the user do not exhibit this posting behavior the resultant dataset used for analysis is generalized anxiety disorder n eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia suicide attempt in order to allow comparison of each condition to control user we gather a random sample of twitter user for whom at least of their post are identified by twitter a english all the user with a selfstated diagnosis and all member of this control population have their age and gender estimated according to sap et al for each user with a selfstated diagnosis we find a matched control through the following procedure create a pool of user where the estimated gender match and the estimated age is within the same year bracket the suggested accuracy of the age estimator from that pool of age and gender matched user we select the user whose tweet start and end over the most similar timeframe we will refer to these age gender and timematched control simply a matched control throughout the rest of this paper all tweet were publicly posted by their author ie no user marked at protected or private were included on average user had tweet the distribution of estimated age and gender for user with each selfstated condition can be seen in figure for most condition the population skews female though for schizophrenia the gender are roughly balanced the average age tends to be in the earlytomid s
