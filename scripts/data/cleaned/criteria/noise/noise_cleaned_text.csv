we employed several quality assurance measure in our data collection process to reduce noisy and unreliable data our survey were only visible to mturk crowdworkers who had completed at least previous task with a minimum approval rating mturk worker with this level of experience and approval rating have been found to provide reliable valid survey response we also restricted access to only american ip address a mturk data collected from outside the united state are generally of poorer quality all participant were only permitted to take the survey once we excluded participant who had successfully completed our survey but who had a lifetime total of fewer than five instagram post we also excluded participant with cesd score of or higher study have indicated that a cesd score of represents an optimal cutoff for identifying clinically relevant depression across a range of age group and circumstance
following our data collection we focused on verifying whether mhs and sw subreddit content actually relate to discussion of mental health concern and suicidal ideation the mhs have been previously examined for understanding mental health discourse on reddit for sw we consulted a licensed clinical psychologistsuicide prevention expert and two active moderator of sw to obtain qualitative grounding that the content in sw indeed related to expression of suicidal ideation example paraphrased title of post from one of the mhs and sw are given in table
automatic detection of selfdisclosure level in post necessitates obtaining gold standard label on selfdisclosure in essence ground truth for the purpose two raters familiar with reddit and it mental health community in particular independently rated a small random sample post with equal proportion from mental health and control subreddits for three level of selfdisclosure no selfdisclosure low and high selfdisclosure these three class of selfdisclosure were chosen based on categorization by bak et al in the raters mutually discussed their label thereafter and thus came up with a set of rule for rating the rule were further aligned with observation in prior work per the rule post that either reveal personal information eg age location gender etc or divulge sensitive or vulnerable thought belief or embarrassingconfessional experience were to be considered to be indicative of high selfdisclosure joinson characterized sensitive disclosure in term of the extent of revealed vulnerability post about self but not disclosing any personal or emotionally vulnerable content wa to be considered of low selfdisclosure no selfdisclosure post were those which were about people or thing other than the posting author and which divulged information unrelated to the self following these mutually agreed upon rule the previous two raters and an additional rater familiar with reddit independently coded a larger sample of post to create a training set for the purpose of classification the raters had good agreement in their rating fleiss kappa wa found to be however given the subjective nature of characterization of selfdisclosure we considered only those post in the training set for which we had agreement across all three raters this gave u post across the three category the coded set consisted of post of high selfdisclosure post of low selfdisclosure and with no selfdisclosure table give example of mental health post excerpt with high selfdisclosure while table and provide example of low and no selfdisclosure post note that including nonmental health post in the training set wa essential so a to let the detector learn on post of low and no selfdisclosure and on those not mental health related
in this study we gathered information on depression level of twitter user and their activity history to do this we published a website to administer a questionnaire and disseminated information about the website over twitter in contrast to de choudhury et al who collected data from englishspeaking user through crowdsourcing this study collected data from japanesespeaking volunteer this approach wa used to investigate the extent to which depression risk can be estimated for a population different from the population considered by the prior research figure show a screenshot of our website the website collected the response to a questionnaire to evaluate the degree of depression of the twitter user who participated hereinafter the participant and to collect the history of participant activity on twitter the activity history of participant were collected through the twitter application programming interface api and the questionnaire to determine degree of depression were completed by participant through their web browser before data collection visitor to the website were presented with a written explanation of the aim of the experiment the information that would be collected and how that information would be handled those who consented to become participant after receiving the explanation logged into their individual twitter account through the oauth authorization process next participant were surveyed on gender age occupation and history of depression following which they answered a questionnaire designed to evaluate degree of depression a message called the kokoro score kokoro is a japanese word meaning heart determined on the basis of answer to the questionnaire and information in the collected tweet wa displayed to participant after completion of the questionnaire fig experiment participant were able to tweet the message displayed which made it possible to promote the website over twitter by wordofmouth in a type of snowball sampling the cesd questionnaire wa used to evaluate the degree of depression in the cesd test participant answered question on a likerttype point scale each answer wa assigned a score of point with the sum of the point from all answer used a the score to estimate likelihood of depression several standard exist by which to determine the appropriate cutoff score for identifying depression in this research we regarded a score of point or higher a indicating active depression and a score of point or lower a indicating no active depression these are the same value a used in and give a cutoff score of in addition answer to bdi a depression scale used with characteristic similar to cesd were collected to ensure the reliability of data for each participant score were calculated on both scale with poor correlation regarded a indicating unreliable answer the time taken to answer the questionnaire wa also recorded and those completed in too brief a time were excluded after each participant answered the questionnaire the activity history of that participant on twitter wa collected from twitter by using the api at most tweet were collected for each participant and the number of user following the participant and being followed by the participant were recorded tweet published after the questionnaire wa taken were discarded the website wa opened to the public on december at which time the author publicized it on their twitter account between december and february people participated in the experiment after eliminating participant who did not tweet and participant who answered the questionnaire in fewer than second a previously mentioned to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire answer set of answer remained only the first set of answer wa used for participant who completed the questionnaire more than once a a result data about experiment participant male female aged to mean year standard deviation year were analyzed the correlation between cesd score and bdi score for these participant were high and there were no participant with uncorrelated score so the data for all participant were used excluded datasets are not discussed any further figure show the histogram of cesd score of participant among the participant resp were estimated to have resp not have active depression for an incidence of approximately this incidence is similar to that found by de choudhury et al who identified depression in approximately of participant table give statistic on the activity history of participant
in an effort to minimize noisy and unreliable data we applied several quality assurance measure in our data collection process mturk worker who have completed at least task with a minimum approval rating have been found to provide reliable valid survey response we restricted survey visibility only to worker with these qualification survey access wa also restricted to u ip address a mturk data collected from outside the united state are generally of poorer quality all participant were only permitted to take the survey once we excluded participant with a total of fewer than five twitter post we also excluded participant with cesd score of or lower depression or tsq score of or lower ptsd study have indicated that a cesd score of represents an optimal cutoff for identifying clinically relevant depression an equivalent tsq cutoff of ha been found to be optimal in the case of ptsd we note here that in the study that inspired the present work de choudhury et al used two depression scale cesd and bdi and filtered individual whose depression score did not correlate across the both scale this additional criterion is a methodological strength of de choudhury et al with respect to the present work
we used a dataset of nonclinical user who opted into a facebook application mypersonality kosinski and stillwell between june and march completed a item personality questionnaire an international personality item pool ipip proxy to the neopir goldberg and shared access to their status update containing at least word user wrote on average of word total word instance and a subset of user provided gender and age in which were female and the mean age wa the dataset wa divided into training and testing sample in particular the testing sample consisted of a random set of user who wrote at least word and completed the personality measure while the training set contained the remaining user
to characterize the difference between clinical and control community a variety of feature are extracted affective feature we use the lexiconaffective norm for english word anew to extract the sentiment conveyed in the content this lexicon consists of word rated in term of valence and arousal and is thus suitable for a quantitative estimation the valence of anew word is on a scale of very unpleasant to very pleasant the arousal is measured on the same scale least active to most active a cloud visualization of anew word used in the blog post made by clinical and control group is illustrated in fig mood tag livejournal provides a mechanism for user to tag their post from a list of predefined mood label thus in addition to the emotion expressed in the text of post the mood tag produced allows u direct access to the user sentiment a cloud visualization of mood tagged on blog post made by clinical and control community is llustrated in fig liwc feature we examine the proportion of word in psycholinguistic category a defined in the liwc package linguistic social affective cognitive perceptual biological relativity personal concern and spoken table present the mean of these liwc psycholinguistic process for the clinical and control community whilst similar in the use word with positive emotion people in the clinical community tend to use word with more negative emotionas example anxiety anger and sadness further they discus more issue about health and death in comparison with the control group on the other hand the user in the control group discus more neutral life related topicsingestion home and leisure word topic for extracting topic latent dirichlet allocation lda is used a a bayesian probabilistic modelling framework lda extract the probability that is word in a topic and then assigns a topic to each word in a document for the inference part we implemented gibbs inference detailed in we set the number of topic to run the gibbs for sample and use the last gibbs sample to interpret the result
a webbased survey of weibo user wa conducted to ass the respondent suicide risk and emotional distress ie depression anxiety and stress the invitation letter to participate in this survey wa widely sent out to general weibo user by various promotion activity for a weibo user to be eligible for the study she or he had to be year or older by selfreport a renminbi incentive for each complete survey wa provided to boost the respond rate with the respondent consent their weibo post that were posted in the public domain during the month before the survey were downloaded by calling weibo api the survey fulfilled the checklist for reporting result of internet esurveys cherry checklist and detail of the procedure have been reported in previous publication in addition when multiple survey feedback were submitted from the same internet protocol address only the first submission wa used to avoid duplicate participation in contrast to a previous study this study excluded those who posted nothing throughout the month but not those who posted fewer than post eventually data provided by respondent remained for further analysis the study ha obtained ethical approval from the human research ethical review committee at the university of hong kong and the institute review board of the institute of psychology at the chinese academy of science the survey measured respondent suicide probability score depression anxiety stress and weibo suicide communication wsc a the outcome variable in addition the respondent weibo post language feature were extracted a independent variable or feature for machine learning the detail of how those data were obtained are elaborated in the following subsection
we first obtained a list of ranked major university in the united state by crawling the u news and world report website this list is constructed based on the carnegie classification employed extensively by higher education researcher and using a set of indicator of academic excellence defined by u news the list includes a variety of university spread across the u in different setting eg urban rural and with a wide range of student enrollment size figure a show their geographic distribution a a part of this crawl we also obtained university metadata gender distribution of student average tuition and fee and academic calendar semesterquarter to obtain further information about the nature of the student body we crawled the wikipedia page of all of the university from these page we extracted the size of student enrollment type publicprivate and setting ruralsuburbanurbancity at every institution these definition come from a formal categorization scheme used by the u department of education the student body enrollment size ranged from to with public and private university university were reported to be urban city suburban and rural finally we obtained information on racial diversity of the university from a website known a priceonomics the website calculates the herfindahlhirschman index hhi by combining the raceethnicity distribution of student body at different university with data given from the department of education hhi range from the least diverse a population of all one type to n the most diverse where n is the number of different racial category being analyzed social medium data of university next we obtained social medium data of the above university specifically we focused on the social medium reddit why reddit reddit is known to be a widely used online forum and social medium site among the college student demographic due to it forum structure it is extensively used for both content sharing a well a for obtaining feedback and information from community of interest reddit harbor a variety of community known a subreddits including many dedicated to specific university campus this allows a large sample of post shared by student of a university to be collected in one place our preliminary manual inspection of university subreddits eg rgatech or rkstate revealed that these subreddits are appropriated by student to discus college topic table focusing on these public reddit community also doe not require explicit data collection effort to be coordinated at each of the university site although more student are likely to use facebook due to it largely privately shared content it is challenging to obtain access to a large dataset of a university student next while twitter is also widely adopted without explicit selfreported information it is challenging to identify college student account finally prior work note that semianonymity of reddit enables candid self disclosure around stigmatized topic like mental health initial data acquisition we leveraged the archive of all of reddit data made available on google bigquery bigquery is a cloud based managed data warehouse that allows third party to access large publicly available dataset through simple sqltype query our query grabbed all post ranging between june and february available in the reddit data archive this included post from unique user across all of the university with a mean of post and unique user per subreddit filling the gap in subreddit data the second step of our data collection process focused on identifying subreddits with insufficient data and supplementing them through additional alternative data collection through reddits official api httpswwwredditcomdevapi we obtained the most recent number of subscriber in the university subreddits a of july then to investigate if and to what extent some subreddits may have had unusually low data a given in step we determined the median unique user to subscriber ratio in each subreddit this allows u to capture the subreddits where the subscriber count is high however the data obtained is not sufficiently representative for subreddits with unique user to subscriber ratio under median in all we performed a onetime data collection using the reddit api this gave u a set of at most most recent post for each subreddit with a total of post added to the data obtained in step following deduplication we note that this procedure did not skew the yearly distribution of data across the subreddits the skew yearly rate of change before and after data filling were and respectively which were found to be statistically equivalent based on a twosample equivalence test p p a test that us two onesided ttests on the beforeafter yearly rate of change from both side of a chosen difference interval
in this work we are focused on two main type of feature linguistic and behavioral tfidf is adopted to model the linguist feature of patient and pattern of life feature plf adopted from the work of coppersmith et al is used to model the behavioral style of patient tfidf feature to capture the frequent and representative word used by the patient tfidf is applied on the unigram and bigram collected from all the patient tweet pattern of life feature plf these feature reveal the emotional pattern and behavioral tendency of user by measuring polarity emotion and social interaction in order to fully compose the plf we combined the following list of feature age and gender twitter doe not publicly provide information about the age and gender of it user mainly due to privacy concern so we adopted the work of sap et al to fill in this information polarity feature the sentiment api wa used to label each tweet a either positive negative or neutral the polarity is furthermore transformed into five different value to capture the affective trait of each user positive ratio the percentage of positive tweet negative ratio the percentage of negative tweet positive combo capture the mania and hypomania trait of patient which is determined by the number of continuous positive post appearing more than x amount of time within a period of time in minute t negative combo capture the depression trait of patient and is determined by the number of continuous negative post appearing more than x amount of time within a period of time in minute t flip ratio quantifies the emotional unstableness and is determined by counting how frequently two continuous tweet with different polarity either positive to negative or negative to positive appear together within a period of time in minute t in our work x is set to and t is set to minute social feature these feature can demonstrate how user are behaving with respect to their environment the following are the social feature designed for each user tweeting frequency the frequency of daily post mention ratio the percentage of post which contain at least one mention of another user frequent mention the number of twitter user mentioned more than three time which is a measurement of how many close friend a particular user may have unique mention the number of unique user mentioned which is a measure of the width of a user social network
we developed six binary classification model each of which categorizes a user specific post into one of the following subreddits rdepression ranxiety rbipolar rbpd rschizophrenia and rautism our conjecture is that a user who suffers from a specific mental problem writes a post on the corresponding subreddit that deal with the problem a user can write post across multiple subreddits if heshe suffers from multiple mental health problem eg a user suffering from both depression and anxiety however if the model is trained with the post of user who have multiple symptom like a prior study the classification model may suffer from noisy data therefore we developed six independent binary classification model for each symptom to improve the performance by developing six independent model for each mental disorder each of which us data where user suffer from only one particular mental problem we were able to accurately identify a user potential mental state for example to develop a model for detecting depression we labeled the post written by user who upload post only in the rdepression a the depression class the opposite class is referred to a the nondepression class to address a classimbalance issue for the collected data we applied the synthetic minority oversampling technique smote algorithm we divided our dataset into training and testing set then xgboost and convolutional neural network cnn were employed morover we excluded the post of user who wrote post across multiple subreddits in learning phase to quantitatively represent each post we converted the word in the training set to numerical representation fig for the xgboost classifier we used the tfidf vectorizer in the sckitlearn package to convert word into ndimensional vector in the case of the cnn classifier we applied wordembedding procedure from the preprocessed text using the wordvec api of python package gensim the word vector were pretrained with the training dataset collected for the current study with continuous bagofwords representation cbow model while the size of window wa set to five note that by using the pretrained wordvec model for representing each post for each subreddit a language style used by user who write post in a subreddit can be trained for the specific subreddit an overview of the proposed cnnbased model is presented in fig the model architecture is organized by the sequence of layer that includes an embedding layer convolutional layer maxpooling layer dense layer and the output fig illustrates how a post is trained in the given model the first layer of the model is an embedding layer that represents the word embeddings of a preprocessed post with dimension and it weight is initialized by the pretrained wordvec second a convolutional layer with input of word vector ha filter and each filter size is five in addition we applied a dropout rate of to prevent overfitting issue the next layer is a maxpooling layer which take the maximum value within the cnn filter and it dimension is the output of the maxpooling layer is passed through two fully connected dense layer and the final output is the probability of the classification through the sigmoid activation function which range from to for training the neural network we used both the binary crossentropy loss function and adam optimizer with a learning rate of our model wa trained through epoch and the batch size wa set to
we now briefly describe our approach for cohortbased study over social medium a more detailed description of the proposed methodology will appear in a forthcoming publication most work on social medium analysis estimate trend by aggregating documentlevel signal inferred from arbitrary and biased data sample selected to match a predefined outcome while some recent work ha begun incorporating demographic information to contextualize analysis mandel et al mitchell et al huang et al and to improve representativeness of the data coppersmith et al b do real and culotta these study still select on specific outcome we depart from these work by constructing a demographically representative digital cohort of social medium user prior to the analysis and then conducting cohortbased study over this preselected population while a significant undertaking in most medical study the vast quantity of available social medium data make assembling social medium cohort feasible such cohort can be used to support longitudinal and crosssectional study allowing expert to contextualize the outcome produce externally valid trend from inherently biased sample and extrapolate those trend to a broader population similar strategy have been utilized in online survey which can have comparable validity to other survey modality simply by controlling for basic demographic feature such a the location age ethnicity and gender duffy et al our cohort construction process entail two key step first randomly selecting a large sample of twitter user and second annotating those user with key demographic attribute while such attribute are not provided by the api automated method can be used to infer such trait from data cesare et al following this approach we develop a demographic inference pipeline to automatically infer age gender raceethnicity and location for each cohort candidate age identifying age based on the content of a user can be challenging and exact age often cannot be determined based on language use alone therefore we use discrete category that provide a more accurate estimate of age teenager below s s s s year or older gender the gender wa inferred using demographer a supervised model that predicts the binary gender of twitter user with feature based on the name field on the user profile knowles et al raceethnicity the standard formulation of race and ethnicity is not well understood by the general public so categorizing social medium user along these two ax may not be reasonable therefore we use a single measure of multicultural expression that includes five category white w asian a black b hispanic h and other location the location wa inferred using carmen an opensource library for geolocating tweet that us a series of rule to lookup location string in a location knowledgebase dredze et al we use the inferred location to select user that live in the united state the age and raceethnicity attribute were inferred with custom supervised classifier based on amir et al s userlevel model the classifier were trained and evaluated on a dataset of k annotated user attaining performance of and average f respectively see the supplemental note for additional detail on these experiment we build on prior work on supervised model for mental health inference over social medium data we focus on two mental health condition depression and ptsd and develop classifier with the selfreported datasets created for clpysch mitchell et al coppersmith et al b these labeled datasets derive from user that have publicly disclosed on twitter a diagnosis of depression user or ptsd user with an equal number of randomly selected demographicallymatched with respect to age and gender user a control for each user the associated metadata and posting history wa also collected up to the most recent tweet per limitation of the twitter api the participant of the task proposed a host of method ranging from rulebased system to various supervised model pedersen preotiucpietro et al coppersmith et al b more recently the neural userlevel classifier proposed by amir et al showed not only good performance on this task but also the ability to capture implicit similarity between user affected by the same disease thus opening the door to more interpretable analysis hence we adopt their model for this analysis
first we removed journal with no text and those with fewer than character leaving million journal for topic modelling next we preprocessed the text using the stanford tweet tokenizer which is a twitteraware tokenizer designed to handle short informal text we used the option that truncates character repeating or more time converting phrase such a im sooooo happyy to im soo happyy on average the number of token per journal wa since we are interested in topic we removed stopwords and token with fewer than two letter and we only retained noun which appear in the wordnet corpus after this filtering the average number of noun per journal wa example of frequently appearing noun in alphabetical order include anxiety class dinner family god job lunch miss school sick sleep and work we then iteratively clustered the journal into topic detail below and removed noun that do not refer to topic such a number timing eg today yesterday general feeling eg feel like proper noun and noun that have ambiguous meaning eg overall true lastly we only retained noun that appeared more than ten time in the dataset this process resulted in a vocabulary of word for topic modelling each journal is represented a a dimensional term frequency vector with each component denoting the termfrequency inversedocumentfrequency tfidf of the corresponding term algorithm summarizes our topic modelling methodology given a tfidf term frequency vector for each journal we run nonnegative matrix factorization nmf implemented in python scikitlearn package the objective of nmf is to find two matrix whose product approximates the original matrix in our case one matrix is the weighted set of topic in each journal and the other is the weighted set of word that belong to each topic hence each journal is represented a a combination of topic which are themselves composed of a weighted combination of word we chose nmf because it nonnegativity constraint aid with interpretability in the context of analyzing word frequency negative presence of a word would not be interpretable this is because we only track word occurrence and not semantics or syntax unlike other matrix factorization method nmf reconstructs each document from a sum of positive part which enables u to easily manually label the discovered topic iterating from to topic we derived different topic matrix step and of algorithm each matrix consists of one topic per row each topic ha a positive weight for each word in the vocabulary stronger weight indicate higher relevance to the topic the final topic matrix we used ha topic and is shown in table we show the first six word in this table for simplicity where we sorted the word associated with each topic from highest relevance to lowest when judging the topic matrix we considered the top twenty most important word per topic using this information we manually labeled each row in the matrix with a corresponding topic furthermore we manually evaluated each matrix based on the distinctness between topic consistency within topic and interpretability during this process we compiled a custom list of removed word that we mentioned earlier in this section the group of word we removed appeared a standalone topic that did not offer information about what the journal wa about for example proper noun appeared a a standalone topic other word which we deemed too general or ambiguous appeared across several topic and hence did not provide discriminative information we tested different level of regularization to enforce sparseness in our model see for a discussion but did not find significant difference however one important modification we made to regularize each topic wa to make their first word only a strong a their second one by default first word are stronger than second word which are stronger than third word and so on this is since the most relevant word for each topic tended to be too strong of a signal regardless of how we changed the number of topic preprocessing procedure or regularization in the objective function for example the word love in a journal about sport would be so strong that the journal would be labeled a relating to romantic love lowering the importance of first word wa sufficient to eliminate the false positive we identified given the final topic matrix summarized in table the next step is to use it to assign label to journal step and of algorithm we plotted the distribution of how important each topic wa to all journal in the dataset with importance ranging from zero to one each distribution had a similar shape with a clear inflection point between to importance figure show an example importance distribution for the topic work where the inflection point occurs at importance
we focus on the social medium platform twitter a popular microblogging service used by of u internet user and whose popularity continues to increase twitter is particularly interesting to study since nearly all post are public the public nature of tweet provides an interesting counterpoint to the private nature of search engine activity we gathered a month sample of twitter firehose stream which includes all public tweet between november and march made available to u under contract focusing on englishlanguage tweet twitter post count and unique user count were computed for each condition and aggregated over the full time period specifically we considered a post to belong to a certain health condition if there wa a regular expression match of the condition to the text of the post this would not permit substring match within term to reduce noise we excluded post that were retweets or contained hyperlink since they were likely related to general news and not a user personal health using this method we obtained tweet on the health condition from user in the time period of interest the median number of post wa per condition from a median of user per conditionwe mined the log of a popular search engine over the same month period used in the twitter analysis focusing on englishlanguage query we processed billion of query from which the query for the health condition of interest were extracted we searched for query that were either an exact match with one of the symptom or condition or those where the condition wa some subset of the query term a with twitter substring match within query term were not permitted to reduce noise we also used synonym of symptom and condition to increase coverage synonym were identified via a twostep walk on the search engine clickgraph using an approach similar to example synonym for abdominal pain included sore stomach and belly ache we applied this procedure to all of the condition note that synonym were not used in the data collection process from twitter to ensure efficiency by limiting the size of the substring match space twitter post are considerably longer than search query we observed search on health condition from user the median number of search wa from a median of user per conditionto gain qualitative insight into people health information seeking and sharing practice we conducted an online survey during june using a recruiting service cint that offer census representative sampling in term of gender and age throughout region of the u respondent were paid approximately usd to complete the survey and were required to have a twitter account to qualify to participate the survey comprised question and took approximately minute to complete participant were asked if they had ever sought health information on a search engine such a google or bing or on twitter and whether they had ever shared health information on twitter if they answered affirmatively they were asked to describe the most recent occasion on which they did so including the health condition that motivated them to search or share and their objective in performing the activity the survey included question about how often participant used search engine and twitter for various type of information seeking or sharing view about risk associated with each platform and basic demographic in total respondent completed the survey after discarding low quality response a determined by nonsensical or sarcastic response to open question valid survey response were analyzed of these respondent were female they resided in u state and the district of columbia and had a college degree or higher age ranged from to year median year respondent reported using search engine frequently at least once per day with only using them le than once per week of respondent had public twitter account while the remaining had protected account ie only approved follower could view their posting
reddit is a social news website where registered user submit content in the form of link or text post user also known a redditors can then vote each submission up or down to rank the post and determine it position or prominence on the site page these two attribute associated with a post are referred to a upvotes and downvotes redditors can also comment on post and respond back in a conversation tree of comment content entry that is the post are organized by area of interest or subcommunities called subreddits such a politics programming or science a of reddits official statistic included billion page view million unique visitor post and comment httpblogredditcom toppostsofstatsandsnooyearshtml we used of reddits official api httpwwwredditcom dev api to collect post comment and associated metadata from several mental health subreddits specifically using a python wrapper praw httpsprawreadthedocsorgen latestindexhtml the subreddits we crawled were alcoholism anxiety bipolarreddit depression mentalhealth mmfb make me feel better socialanxiety suicidewatch all of these subreddits host public content in order to arrive at a comprehensive list of subreddits to focus on we utilized reddits native subreddit search feature httpwwwredditcomreddits and searched for subreddits on mental health two researcher familiar with reddit employed an initial filtering step on the search result returned so that we focus on high precision subreddits discussing mental health concern and issue thereafter we focused on a snowball approach in which starting with a few seed subreddits mentalhealth depression we compiled a second list of related or similar subreddits that are listed in the profile page of the seed subreddits following a second filtering step we arrived at the list of subreddits listed above for each of these subreddits we obtained daily crawl of their post in the new category corresponding to each post we collected information on the title of the post the body or textual content id timestamp when the post wa made author id and the number of upvotes and downvotes it obtained since post gather comment over a period of time following the time of sharing we crawled all of the comment per post that were shared over a three day period after the post wa made qualitative examination of the subreddits of interest revealed that or more of the comment to any post were typically made in a three day window following the time the post is madehence the choice the crawl of the subreddits used in this paper we present some descriptive statistic of our crawled data our dataset contained post with at least one comment and comment in all with unique user who made post comment or both a set of user were found to write both at least one post and comment cdf of the user distribution over post and comment is given in figure the figure show the expected heavy tail trend observed in several social phenomenon also see figure for the distribution of comment over time following post share it illustrates the quick responsivity culture in the community we study peak at hour some of the additional statistic of our dataset are given in table further example title of a few
next we assessed the suitability and reliability of our collected corpus of instagram post and user for our later analysis for the purpose we extracted ngrams n from the profile biography of user the top uni bi and trigram are shown in table they show that user are appropriating instagram to seek and provide social and emotional support around different mental health concern need someone talk feel free dm there are also explicit mention of specific psychological challenge around mental health depression anxiety telling suicidal kid including warning for profile visitor trigger warning and personal experience of the condition alone alone alone we corroborated these observation with a licensed psychiatrist and concluded that the user in our dataset are engaging in genuine mental health disclosure tend to demonstrate disinhibition towards sharing their mental health experience and are appropriating the platform specifically for this purpose via the chosen account
tweet about depression were collected by simply measured a company that specializes in social medium measurement and analytics simply measured simply measured ha access to the twitter firehose or full volume of tweet via gnip a licensed company that can retrieve the full twitter data stream all tweet in the english language that contained at least either depressed depressed depression or depression were collected between april and may we scanned a random sample of the tweet to identify common phrase that included our keywords of interest but were not about mental health in sa version sa institute inc cary nc we used the index function which search a character expression in this case the text of the tweet for a specific string of character to locate and remove such tweet from our sample we removed tweet that included the following term regardless of capitalization great depression economic depression during the depression depression era tropical depression and depressed real estate the popularity and influence of the tweeter wa described using the distribution of follower and klout score while number of follower is a measure of popularity klout score is a measure of influence klout score range from to with a higher score indicating higher influence klout score is calculated based on an algorithm that considers over signal from eight different online network example of signal include the amount of retweets a person generates in relation to the amount of tweet shared and the amount of engagement a user drive from unique individual eg lot of retweets from different individual a opposed to lot of retweets from one person klout inc
we follow the data acquisition and curation process of coppersmith et al a summarizing the major point here social medium such a twitter contains frequent public statement by user reporting diagnosis for various medical condition many talk about physical health condition eg cancer flu but some also discus mental illness including schizophrenia there are a variety of motivation for user to share this information on social medium to offer or seek support to fight the stigma of mental illness or perhaps to offer an explanation for certain behavior we obtain message with these selfreported diagnosis using the twitter api and filtered via caseinsensitive regular expression to require schizo or a close phonetic approximation to be present our expression matched schizophrenia it subtypes and various approximation schizo skitzo skitso schizotypal schizoid etc all data we collect are public post made between and and exclude any message marked a private by the author all use of the data reported in this paper ha been approved by the appropriate institutional review board irb each selfstated diagnosis included in this study wa examined by a human annotator one of the author to verify that it appeared to be a genuine statement of a schizophrenia diagnosis excluding joke quote or disingenuous statement we obtained user with an apparently genuine selfstated diagnosis of a schizophreniarelated condition note that we cannot be certain that the twitter user wa actually diagnosed with schizophrenia only that their statement of being diagnosed appears to be genuine previous work indicates that interannotator agreement for this task is good coppersmith et al a for each user we obtained a set of their public twitter post via the twitter api collecting up to tweet a we wish to focus on userauthored content we exclude from analysis all retweets and any tweet that contain a url which often contain text that the user did not author we lowercase all word and convert any nonstandard character including emoji to a systematic ascii representation via unidecode for our community control we used randomlyselected twitter user who primarily tweet in english specifically during a two week period in early each twitter user who wa included in twitter spritzer sample had an equal chance for inclusion in our pool of community control we then collected some of their historic tweet and assessed the language they tweeted in according to the chromium compact language detector user were excluded from our community control if their tweet were le than english
next we compiled a list of reported celebrity suicide which fell within the time range of our reddit data defining who is a celebrity is nontrivial so we refer to the wikipedia page listing celebrity suicide a a way to measure who ha sufficient celebrity status for inclusion we obtained reported celebrity suicide in the same period a our reddit data their name and reported suicide are shown in table we measure the prominence of a celebrity death by measuring the change in wikipedia page view for the celebrity wikipedia page wikipedia provides daily page view statistic for each page we compare the number of pageviews in the two week prior to their death with the two week following their death in term of zscore figure here zscores are computed by converting the page view to standard normal variable with mean and standard deviation of for of the case we see a notable spike in number of view showing that the suicide of these individual were wellknown enough to be viewable on such a macro scale and for examining the presence of werther effect in social medium we note two aspect related to the above analysis and which will be used through the rest of this paper first since we are focusing on different type of data sourceswikipedia and reddit we use zscore conversion a a normalization technique for the wikipedia page view and reddits sw posting activity volume further the above observation in wikipedia data and the analysis that ensue focus on observing change over a two week window preceding and succeeding a celebrity suicide this choice is motivated by our initial analysis and from the literature on werther effect a mentioned earlier we examine data from reddit we provide a description of the feature of this social medium platform which are important to understand the context of our research problem reddit allows user to submit content in the form of link or text post organized by area of interest or subcommunities called subreddits eg politics programming science user can voice their opinion on the post via a voting mechanism which allows more popular submission to be featured more prominently according to their score the difference between the upvotes and downvotes cast on each post also known a score user can also engage with each other via a comment thread attached to each post in reddit had billion page view over active community million post and million comment in this paper we focus specifically on the subreddit called suicidewatch a forum for user contemplating suicide and who seek help advice and support it is a strong support community with currently about k subscriber the community is highly moderated with many of it moderator and active subscriber adopting prominent role in providing support to individual showing vulnerability in this subreddit vote on post are used a a proxy for support and to increase or decrease a post prominence rather than a a statement of agreementdisagreement we used reddits official api to collect post comment and associated metadata from rsuicidewatch hereafter sw our analysis in this paper is based on all post made to sw between october and december post from unique user example paraphrased title of post from rsuicidewatch are given in table we collected the title of the post the body or textual content id timestamp author id the number of upvotes and downvotes the post obtained including the difference between upvotes and downvotes on the post ie score
we briefly explain the data collection method here but we refer the interested reader with further question on the methodology to coppersmith et al for the suicide attempt data and coppersmith et al a for all other condition the data for these analysis are twitter post collected via two method most of the data come from user who have publicly discussed their mental health condition these user are frequently referred to a selfstated diagnosis user a they state publicly something like i wa diagnosed with schizophrenia or im so thankful to have survived my suicide attempt last year the data for user with a suicide attempt wa supplemented by data from ourdatahelpsorg a data donation site where people provide access to their public post and fill out a short questionnaire about their mental health history data are then deidentified and made available to researcher addressing question of interest to the mental health community donor provide consent for their data to be used in mental health research upon signup of the user who attempted suicide came from ourdatahelpsorg specifically we examine generalized anxiety disorder eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia and attempted suicide these condition were selected based on the theory that there are important timing aspect to their symptom ebbing and flowing of symptom a treatment is effective especially schizophrenia onset and exacerbation of symptom by external event and stress and punctuated event in time of psychological symptom suicide attempt panic attack and bingingpurging behavior with eating disorder we use the twitter streaming api to collect a sample of user who used a series of mental health word or phrase in their tweet text eg schizophrenia or suicide attempt each tweet that us one of these phrase is examined via regular expression to indicate that the user is talking about themselves finally those tweet that pas the regular expression are examined by a human to confirm to the best of our ability that their selfstatement of diagnosis appears to be genuine this result in a dataset with user that have a selfstated diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder n an eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia or someone who would go on to attempt suicide some of these user do not exhibit the sort of posting behavior required to create micropatterns ie they rarely post multiple time within a hour time window we exclude these user from our analysis which is of user for most condition with the exception of those with a suicide attempt where a little over half the user do not exhibit this posting behavior the resultant dataset used for analysis is generalized anxiety disorder n eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia suicide attempt in order to allow comparison of each condition to control user we gather a random sample of twitter user for whom at least of their post are identified by twitter a english all the user with a selfstated diagnosis and all member of this control population have their age and gender estimated according to sap et al for each user with a selfstated diagnosis we find a matched control through the following procedure create a pool of user where the estimated gender match and the estimated age is within the same year bracket the suggested accuracy of the age estimator from that pool of age and gender matched user we select the user whose tweet start and end over the most similar timeframe we will refer to these age gender and timematched control simply a matched control throughout the rest of this paper all tweet were publicly posted by their author ie no user marked at protected or private were included on average user had tweet the distribution of estimated age and gender for user with each selfstated condition can be seen in figure for most condition the population skews female though for schizophrenia the gender are roughly balanced the average age tends to be in the earlytomid s
we note that the candidate mental health disclosure data sample is prone to significant noise it is possible that although a user us one of the mental health keyphrases in their twitter post it may not indicate a genuine disclosure eg when i have to wake up at am i feel like killing myself doe not indicate a person real intention of taking their life to eliminate such user we adopt a semisupervised machine learning method in which we compare the language of each user in our twitter dataset with the language of a selfidentified set of social medium user suffering a from mental illness for the purpose we obtain a large sample of post from user made on the reddit subcommunities rdepression rmentalhealth and rsuicidewatch between february and november we use this dataset a weak signal of the language used by individual identifying with a form of mental illness prior work ha also indicated that the disclosure made on these forum are genuine disclosure of mental illness and have also been validated through consultation with a psychiatrist our approach proceeds a follows step we create twitter usercentric vectorrepresentations by collating all of their post this would give u a many vector a the number of user in the candidate disclosure sample we also similarly create a single vector representation by collating all post in our reddit dataset step next we establish comparative validity across the twitter vector and the reddit vector this is an important step because the language of twitter and reddit cannot be directly compared due to the unique affordances of each site and the seeming difference in the demographic of the two for each of these vector we perform linguistic normalization of tokenized item in them then we compute the average automated readability index ari on all of the normalized twitter vector and the reddit vector we observe the ari differential between the two to be indicating that the language are close to standardized internet speak and hence comparable following normalization step next we build ngram language model n for both the normalized twitter vector and the single reddit vector we then determine cosine similarity score between the language model of each normalized twitter vector and the reddit vector step finally we obtain the distribution of cosine similarity over all normalized twitter vector see figure a we construct the genuine disclosure dataset of user to be those vector of user for whom the cosine similarity of their language model with that of reddits is greater than or equal to the median similarity across all vector median distance our final dataset of genuine mental illness disclosure consisted of user we will refer to this set a the mid user
the selection of the tweet and their user wa based on the filtered realtime streaming support provided by the twitter api in the first step we selected the user who showed potential sign of depression on twitter on the basis of the most frequent word in spanish expressed by patient suffering from depression in clinical setting these word were jointly identified and selected by a psychologist and a family physician with clinical experience and were based on the definition and general feature of depression according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder the list of word used and their english translation are shown in textbox during june tweet including or more occurrence of the word listed in textbox were collected from this collection of tweet and to select the user who publicly stated in the textual description associated to their profile that they suffered from depression all the profile description including or more occurrence of the word depr and all the possible derivation related to the word depression in spanish such a depre depresin depresivo depresiva deprimido and deprimida were considered from the user who included or more of these word in their description profile user who stated they suffered from depression or were receiving treatment for depression were selected for the analysis this selection wa performed by a psychologist verifying that the statement were related to real expression of depression excluding quote joke or fake one for each of these depressed twitter user we collected all the most recent tweet from their timeline up to a maximum of about tweet thus a total of tweet were collected a figure that wa reduced to after discarding the retweets these tweet constituted the depressive user dataset example of sentence appearing in the user profile that were used for selecting the depressive user are paciente psiquitrico con depresin crnica psychiatric patient with chronic depression example of a profile sentence that indicates depression colecciono errores traducidos a tweet depresivos y a uno que otro impulso de amor i gather error translated into depressing tweet and into one or another love impulse example of a profile sentence that doe not indicate depression once the user with profile sentence indicating depression had been retrieved their twitter timeline were collected only those user having in their timeline at least tweet that suggested sign of depression were retained for further analysis for each user the selection of these tweet wa performed by manually inspecting the tweet of the user complete timeline in reverse temporal order starting from the most recent one to the oldest tweet of the timeline retrieved by mean of the twitter api finally a total number of tweet issued by the depressive user suggesting sign of depression were detected and used for the analysis this set of tweet provided u with the depressive tweet dataset which wa used to analyze linguistic feature of tweet showing sign of depression it ha to be mentioned that these tweet were not to be included in the depressive user dataset see figure at the same time more than tweet were also collected in june such tweet were gathered by listening to the public twitter stream during this time span by only considering tweet with spanish textual content a detected by twitter language identification support given that twitter requires more restrictive filter than just the language of the tweet we used a list of the most frequently used spanish word stopwords to retrieve all tweet that included or more of these word the vast majority of spanish tweet should match this criterion a sample of user who did not mention in their profile the word depression and it derivation were selected randomly from the tweet the complete timeline of these user were compiled tweet which were reduced to once retweets were removed these tweet constituted the control dataset to identify the language of a tweet we relied on the language automatically identified by twitter for each tweet selecting tweet in spanish it ha to be noted that these data can contain some tweet from unidentified depressive user
data wa collected from cup of tea an anonymous online chatbased peer support community for emotional distress user agree at signup that their data may be used for the purpose of research all the data used for the current study wa anonymous and securely stored this research wa performed in line with the ethical and privacy protocol outlined in detail in benton et al data from cup take the form of written dialogue between user of the service and volunteer who are trained a active listener a fragment of an exchange between the user of the service u and the volunteer v might go a follows for the analysis reported in this paper we used only text generated by user of the service not the volunteer providing peer support user who reported depression a their primary concern at sign up were eligible for inclusion in analysis our original sample wa comprised of conversation involving unique user user were excluded from the sample if they did not indicate their culture or if they selected other this resulted in the exclusion of and user respectively the original sample also included user identifying a native american or american indian this group wa excluded from analysis since the majority of the data among these user wa not english this resulted in the removal of user leaving a total sample size of
selection criterion and data scope to understand the impact of cultural difference on how individual use online mental health platform we begin our analysis by creating a dataset of user from different national community on talklife a support platform with over half a million user for this analysis due to the fact that most research in cscw on mental health online ha been done either agnostic of cultural context or in a western context we choose to focus on user from nonwestern country following zhang et al a researcher located in the global south and with lived experience interacting with the health system and diverse explanatory model of mental illness we believe that moving the focus of cscw and cscwadjacent mental health research away from the west is crucial to better meet the need of people often underserved by the medical system to create these subgroup of user we choose the three nonwestern country with the highest user population on talklife or india malaysia and the philippine guided by the rich amount of literature on the unique nuance to mental health expression for each country we examine the national identity linguistic and behaviorbased difference of use between each user subgroup in particular this research note that a a result of cultural norm around the sharing of distress and alternative conceptualization of mental illness in india malaysia and the philippine symptom are often expressed in somatic and religious term a opposed to traditionally clinical or psychiatric term we choose to analyze each subgroup at the national level for both theoretical and practical reason on a theoretical level in past work in the medical anthropology of mental health national identity ha commonly been used for a approximate level of analysis for cultural identity additionally on a more practical level each user country wa determined using their ip address by talklife and shared with u in an useranonymized dataset inferring a more precise location could potentially compromise user anonymity a discussed in past work and did not seem to have any more significant value for our analysis of cultural difference than analysis at the national level we analyze data from indian user malaysian user and filipino user a shown in table collectively we refer to these country a the minority sample a a comparison set we construct a random sample of all thread on talklife and refer to it a the majority sample due to the relative prevalence of user from western englishspeaking country in talklife most of the thread in the majority sample include post from country such a the usa uk and canada indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on talklife data wa sampled from may to june following this crossnational analysis to see if our broader result on talklife generalize to a differently structured online mental health community we picked the largest western country the united state and the largest nonwestern country india represented on cup a similar support platform with more than user actively using the platform each week using cup data we repeat our analysis testing for the same cultural difference we found in our talklife sample for this analysis we were provided a sample of data on activity from indian user and american user a shown in table unlike our sample of talklife user this dataset is not a random sample there is an upsampling of indian user to ensure that we have data from a sufficient number of indian in the dataset like on talklife indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on cup we focus on indian user due to a lack of sufficient data on user from malaysia or the philippine data wa sampled from march august defining cultural identity and use of clinical language in this work we examine the relationship between cultural identity and use of online mental health support forum to do so we leverage tomlinsons definition of cultural identity a self and communal definition based around specific usually politically inflected differentiation gender sexuality class religion race and ethnicity nationality particularly looking at the aspect that of modern cultural identity that run along national line a delineated by hall et al a a diverse and amorphous form of identity cultural identity can often intersect and interact with other form of identity including religious or ethnic identity however in the absence of direct information about religious or ethnic identity based on the data available we use national identity a a proxy for cultural identity additionally following schlesinger et al call for more intersectional analysis and method within hci we also include analysis of adjacent and intersecting identity when relevant including religious identity to analyze clinical language we use a broader definition of clinical language than just specific medical diagnosis following method used in past work to analyze antidepressant related language we create a dataset of clinical mental health language including unigrams bigram and trigram from a list of mental disorder a defined by the international classification of disease icd and diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder dsm we also included all unigrams from the macmillan dictionary list of word used to describe illness and disease both specifically for mental illness and general illness a a result we include unigrams like night from night terror or sleep from sleep disorder a these are often correlated with specific symptom of mental illness or distress such a sleep issue or being awake at night this included any clinically common abbreviation for mental disorder such a ocd for obsessive compulsive disorder or bpd for borderline personality disorder shorthand for disorder commonly used by online community such a proana a used in proeating disorder community were not included due to the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of these term across disorder we choose to use term from and associated with dsm and icd categorized disorder a a result of the common usage of these framework globally throughout our analysis of these varied factor we use to represent mean and to represent standard deviation constraint limitation and tradeoff cultural identity can exist at many different and intersecting level including subculture and subcommunities within the larger umbrella of a cultural identity a a result for the purpose of this analysis we had to adopt some constraint in order to do a meaningful and specific analysis one large limiting constraint that we chose for this study is to use national identity at the state level a a proxy for cultural identity though a major and formative part of modern cultural identity a argued by both hall and tomlinson each country we analyze is incredibly diverse with many individual cultural identity that both intersect and diverge from a greater national identity a more rich analysis of these other form of cultural identity is beyond the scope of this work but could lead to richer conclusion about the nature of cultural identity in online mental health support community particularly with regard to cultural difference between user with the same national identity additionally to stay consistent between analysis a a result of a lack of data on user from malaysia and the philippine we only analyze user in india on cup and extend these finding to the experience of being part of a minority group on an online mental health forum we draw validity for these exploratory finding from similar consistent pattern we observe between indian malaysian and filipino user but a deeper analysis with a larger dataset is likely necessary to determine when and for which minority community these conclusion do not hold true additionally while we construct clinical language through use of the commonly used dsm and icd both framework of illness categorization have significant limitation particularly in the country we have selected for example there are both mental health disorder that are culturebound a well a mental health language that is used in different way within the specific country we analyze such a depression often being an umbrella term for all mental illness additionally it is clear that online support community often develop their own cultural norm and language around mental health and a deeper understanding of how this play out on talklife and cup is neither the focus nor within the scope of this work in this work we intentionally use standard clinical and medical term for mental health disorder in our analysis of clinical language a detailed in past anthropological research it is theorized that the use of medical and clinical language is representative of a medicalized explanatory model of illness and we frame use of this language across culture a a approximate signifier of a greater awareness of the presence of a mental disorder a opposed to conceptualizing distress a stress tension or depression for our analysis we strictly analyzed post that were in the latin alphabet with almost all post on both talklife and cup being in english however a both malay and tagalog are most commonly written in the latin script and since it is common for user from india speaker to use romanized version of indian language online it is possible that a small minority of post in our analysis were text in a different language however a confirmed by only seeing english word used in our analysis of the top ngrams among each user subgroup it is clear that english is the predominant language on both platform though beyond the immediate scope of this work a greater analysis of nonenglish codeswitching on these platform could lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of interaction on expression between user with the same national identity but different language preference
in this section we first present the data gathered and used in our analysis researcher interested in the code and the data are invited to contact the author reddit is a website which enables user to aggregate rate and discus news entertainment politics and many other topic according to alexa it is the th most popular website in the world it wa estimated by the pew research center that of online adult use reddit the site is organized into a collection of subreddits each focused on a particular topic and administered by a collection of moderator the subreddit rsuicidewatch is a forum in which online user are encouraged to post their thought regarding suicide at the time of our data collection it had over subscriber sometimes user express a preoccupation with the thought of suicide other time user discus immediate plan to take their own life these post often contain a description of their mental state including depression reaction to stress their feeling of being alone and having a low selfesteem while most online source of data are notoriously noisy this particular subreddit is remarkably clean given the serious nature of the subreddit individual are le likely to post harassing comment or offtopic remark when user post such comment the moderator of the subreddit quickly remove them we collected all post from it inception in to each post is often commented on by other individual in this work we focused on the original post a it most often represents the suicidal ideation of a user and comment often represent emotional support from other user we cleaned this data first we removed empty post in which the content had been deleted second we removed link and replaced them with the word link third we concatenated the text of the post to the title a many user begin their post in the title and continue in the body of the post finally we removed punctuation and other special character after cleaning this data we had post with word of which word were unique posted by unique user
reddit is a multilingual online social network founded in and organized in subcommunities by area of interest called subreddits we obtained data from the reddits data repository focusing on four subreddits where people discus issue related to mental heath disorder depression rdepression suicide watch rsuicide watch anxiety ranxiety and bipolar rbipolar our dataset is comprised of user activity post and comment that took place between and here we focus on data from january to december in total we obtained post and comment from unique user table i show the total number of user post and comment per subreddit the total number of comment in each community is at least time larger than the number of post which suggests a supportive behavior among user
