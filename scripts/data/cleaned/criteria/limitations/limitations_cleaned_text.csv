data collection wa crowdsourced using amazon mechanical turk mturk crowdwork platform separate survey were created for depressed and healthy individual in the depressed survey participant were invited to complete a survey that involved passing a series of inclusion criterion responding to a standardized clinical depression survey answering question related to demographic and history of depression and sharing social medium history we used the cesd center for epidemiologic study depression scale questionnaire to screen participant depression level cesd assessment quality ha been demonstrated a onpar with other depression inventory including the beck depression inventory and the kellner symptom questionnaire healthy participant were screened to ensure no history of depression and active instagram use see additional file for actual survey text qualified participant were asked to share their instagram usernames and history an app embedded in the survey allowed participant to securely log into their instagram account and agree to share their datab upon securing consent we made a onetime collection of participant entire instagram posting history in total we collected photograph from instagram user of whom had a history of depression we asked a different set of mturk crowdworkers to rate the instagram photograph collected this new task asked participant to rate a random selection of photo from the data we collected raters were asked to judge how interesting likable happy and sad each photo seemed on a continuous scale each photo wa rated by at least three different raters and rating were averaged across raters raters were not informed that photo were from instagram nor were they given any information about the study participant who provided the photo including mental health status each rating category showed good interrater agreement only a subset of participant instagram photo were rated n we limited rating data to a subset because this task wa timeconsuming for crowdworkers and so proved a costly form of data collection for the depressed sample rating were only made for photo posted within a year in either direction of the date of first depression diagnosis within this subset for each user the nearest post prior to the diagnosis date were rated for the control population the most recent photo from each user date of participation in this study were ratedseveral different type of information were extracted from the collected instagram data we used total post per user per day a a measure of user activity we gauged community reaction by counting the number of comment and like each posted photograph received face detection software wa used to determine whether or not a photograph contained a human face a well a count the total number of face in each photo a a proxy measure for participant social activity level pixellevel average were computed for hue saturation and value hsv three color property commonly used in image analysis hue describes an image coloring on the light spectrum ranging from red to bluepurple lower hue value indicate more red and higher hue value indicate more blue saturation refers to the vividness of an image low saturation make an image appear grey and faded value refers to image brightness lower brightness score indicate a darker image see figure for a comparison of high and low hsv value we also checked metadata to ass whether an instagramprovided filter wa applied to alter the appearance of a photograph collectively these measure served a the feature set in our primary model for the separate model fit on rating data we used only the four rating category happy sad likable interesting a predictor
we split our data into two sequential time period t from feb to aug and t from aug to november using these two time period we created two set of user note that since reddit doe not enforce the real name rule of having exactly one account per person our reference to user in this paper is equivalent to user account first we identified those user that posted on mhs during t but did not post on sw during t or t ie user that discus mental health topic but not on sw hereafter mh the second class included those who posted on mhs during t and posted in sw during t ie user that discus mental health topic originally not related to suicide but eventually transition to talk about suicide hereafter mh sw figure show a schematic description of our user class construction note that by focusing on user that initiate at least one post on sw or the mhs a opposed to only commenting we can focus on those frequenting the community for support disregarding those primarily providing help through commentary this split yielded mh sw user which is of the total number of account who posted in mhs but never on sw during either of the period to construct a mh cohort of equal size who did not post on sw in either period we randomly sampled a set of user from the user note although mh user did not post on sw during our timeframe of analysis they may have done so outside the bound of our analysis to support our goal of characterizing difference between the mh sw and mh user we obtained via reddits api the timeline of post and comment authored by the user the api only provides the last public post and comment for a user for each post we obtained their associated metadata eg vote difference or score and comment our final dataset contained post and comment from the mh sw user and post and comment from the mh user we note an important concern individual may post suicidal thought on mhs never engaging on sw and thus corrupting the mhs data with discussion of suicidal ideation we argue against this possibility sw is a prominent suicide support forum and the role of this community in suicide prevention and in acting a an inoculator of vulnerable thought is wellrecognized most mhs eg rdepression clearly specify in their guideline that suicidal thought should go to sw it usually better to post anything that specifically involves suicidal thought or intent in rsuicidewatch rather than here if youre concerned about someone else who may be at risk for suicide please check out their talking tip and risk assessment guide finally discussion with the moderator of sw confirmed that active step are taken to move all suicidal ideation related content to sw given these consideration we expect that few suicidal ideation post appear on subreddits outside of sw
we used reddits official api to collect post comment on post and associated metadata from several mental health focused subreddits we build on the data collection methodology we used in in order to arrive at a comprehensive list of subreddits to focus on we utilized reddits native subreddit search feature httpwwwredditcomreddits we searched for subreddits on mental health two researcher familiar with reddit employed an initial filtering step on the search result returned so that we seed on high precision subreddits discussing mental health concern thereafter we focused on a snowball approach to compile a second list of related or similar subreddits that are mentioned in the profile page of the seed subreddits sample of subreddits in all we crawled are given in table note all of these subreddits host public content for the purpose of selfdisclosure detection we also identified subreddits sample listed in table a our control group total of subreddits meaning they are unrelated to mental health topic for sanity check we randomly sampled a set of post from the control subreddits and two researcher familiar with reddit manually checked their content for presence of any mental health content we found that of subreddit content in our sample were not about any mental health concern cohens kappa for interrater agreement wa in all our dataset had post from user in the mental health subreddits and post from user in the control forum for each of the unique user in the mental health forum we further collected all of their reddit postcomment history last postscomments per reddit api limit if their number of post and comment in our dataset wa five or more this gave u user and m postscommentsautomatic detection of selfdisclosure level in post necessitates obtaining gold standard label on selfdisclosure in essence ground truth for the purpose two raters familiar with reddit and it mental health community in particular independently rated a small random sample post with equal proportion from mental health and control subreddits for three level of selfdisclosure no selfdisclosure low and high selfdisclosure these three class of selfdisclosure were chosen based on categorization by bak et al in the raters mutually discussed their label thereafter and thus came up with a set of rule for rating the rule were further aligned with observation in prior work per the rule post that either reveal personal information eg age location gender etc or divulge sensitive or vulnerable thought belief or embarrassingconfessional experience were to be considered to be indicative of high selfdisclosure joinson characterized sensitive disclosure in term of the extent of revealed vulnerability post about self but not disclosing any personal or emotionally vulnerable content wa to be considered of low selfdisclosure no selfdisclosure post were those which were about people or thing other than the posting author and which divulged information unrelated to the self following these mutually agreed upon rule the previous two raters and an additional rater familiar with reddit independently coded a larger sample of post to create a training set for the purpose of classification the raters had good agreement in their rating fleiss kappa wa found to be however given the subjective nature of characterization of selfdisclosure we considered only those post in the training set for which we had agreement across all three raters this gave u post across the three category the coded set consisted of post of high selfdisclosure post of low selfdisclosure and with no selfdisclosure table give example of mental health post excerpt with high selfdisclosure while table and provide example of low and no selfdisclosure post note that including nonmental health post in the training set wa essential so a to let the detector learn on post of low and no selfdisclosure and on those not mental health related
in this study we gathered information on depression level of twitter user and their activity history to do this we published a website to administer a questionnaire and disseminated information about the website over twitter in contrast to de choudhury et al who collected data from englishspeaking user through crowdsourcing this study collected data from japanesespeaking volunteer this approach wa used to investigate the extent to which depression risk can be estimated for a population different from the population considered by the prior research figure show a screenshot of our website the website collected the response to a questionnaire to evaluate the degree of depression of the twitter user who participated hereinafter the participant and to collect the history of participant activity on twitter the activity history of participant were collected through the twitter application programming interface api and the questionnaire to determine degree of depression were completed by participant through their web browser before data collection visitor to the website were presented with a written explanation of the aim of the experiment the information that would be collected and how that information would be handled those who consented to become participant after receiving the explanation logged into their individual twitter account through the oauth authorization process next participant were surveyed on gender age occupation and history of depression following which they answered a questionnaire designed to evaluate degree of depression a message called the kokoro score kokoro is a japanese word meaning heart determined on the basis of answer to the questionnaire and information in the collected tweet wa displayed to participant after completion of the questionnaire fig experiment participant were able to tweet the message displayed which made it possible to promote the website over twitter by wordofmouth in a type of snowball sampling the cesd questionnaire wa used to evaluate the degree of depression in the cesd test participant answered question on a likerttype point scale each answer wa assigned a score of point with the sum of the point from all answer used a the score to estimate likelihood of depression several standard exist by which to determine the appropriate cutoff score for identifying depression in this research we regarded a score of point or higher a indicating active depression and a score of point or lower a indicating no active depression these are the same value a used in and give a cutoff score of in addition answer to bdi a depression scale used with characteristic similar to cesd were collected to ensure the reliability of data for each participant score were calculated on both scale with poor correlation regarded a indicating unreliable answer the time taken to answer the questionnaire wa also recorded and those completed in too brief a time were excluded after each participant answered the questionnaire the activity history of that participant on twitter wa collected from twitter by using the api at most tweet were collected for each participant and the number of user following the participant and being followed by the participant were recorded tweet published after the questionnaire wa taken were discarded the website wa opened to the public on december at which time the author publicized it on their twitter account between december and february people participated in the experiment after eliminating participant who did not tweet and participant who answered the questionnaire in fewer than second a previously mentioned to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire answer set of answer remained only the first set of answer wa used for participant who completed the questionnaire more than once a a result data about experiment participant male female aged to mean year standard deviation year were analyzed the correlation between cesd score and bdi score for these participant were high and there were no participant with uncorrelated score so the data for all participant were used excluded datasets are not discussed any further figure show the histogram of cesd score of participant among the participant resp were estimated to have resp not have active depression for an incidence of approximately this incidence is similar to that found by de choudhury et al who identified depression in approximately of participant table give statistic on the activity history of participantsit is possible to extract various feature from the activity history of twitter user this section explains what kind of feature are used to estimate degree of depression and the way in which these quantity are extracted table show the feature used in this study a detailed explanation of each feature follows the frequency of word in a tweet ie it bag of word are used a a basic feature relating to the content of the tweet tsugawa et al showed that the word frequency are useful for identifying depression mecab wa used to for morphological stemming and categorization of the japanese tweet text to obtain accurate word frequency particle auxiliary verb adnominal adjective and visual symbol were excluded for extracting content word word used by only one participant were also excluded resulting in a total of distinct word however most of these word were rarely used and the distribution of word frequency is extremely biased see fig because word with a low rate of use were regarded a unlikely to be associated with depression for most user the frequency of only the word with the highest rate of use corresponding to or more us across all participant were used a a feature in this study furthermore because the number and length of tweet differed by participant the word frequency were normalized by the total number of word in the tweet the topic of the tweet of each user a estimated by using a representative topic model lda were used a a second feature relating to the content of the tweet with lda the distribution of topic in each document is estimated from the word frequency in each text through unsupervised learning on the assumption that the text and the word in it are generated according to a particular topic in lda the number of topic to identify and a set of document a bag of word are used a input and a topic distribution is output for each document a mentioned in related work section the topic of essay written by university student were estimated by using lda and found to be useful in evaluating degree of depression from that study topic are expected to be a useful feature a set of all tweet of each user wa used a the user document for input in lda and the word selected a described above were used a the word we used lda with collapsed gibbs sampling a the parameter of lda we used k and where k is the number of topic all extracted topic were used a the feature the ratio of positive word and the ratio of negative word used in the tweet text are used a the final feature relating to tweet content user with depression are intuitively expected to use negative word more frequently than user without depression do to categorize word a dictionary of affective word which is compiled by manual evaluation of a dictionary of positive and negative word extracted according to a technique proposed in the literature is used the dictionary contains positive word and negative word the user timing of tweet frequency of tweet average number of word retweet rate rate of republishing other user tweet mention rate rate of directly referencing at least one other user ratio of tweet containing a uniform resource locator url number of user being followed and number of user following are used a feature independent of the content of the tweet the relative ratio of tweet posted during each hour of the day were used to characterize the timing of tweet the number of post per day wa used a the posting frequency and the ratio of qualifying tweet to all tweet were used for the retweet ratio mention ratio and ratio of tweet containing a url these feature are used in prior research
we extracted several category of predictor from the twitter post collected predictor selection for both depression and ptsd wa based on prior machine learning model of depression in twitter data a the two condition high comorbidity rate suggest their predictive signal may exhibit considerable overlap depressed twitter user have been observed to tweet le frequently than nondepressed user so we used total tweet per user per day a a measure of user activity tweet metadata wa analyzed to ass average word count per tweet here a word is defined a a set of character surrounded by whitespace whether or not the tweet wa a retweet and whether or not the tweet wa a reply to someone el tweet the labmt liwc and anew unigram sentiment instrument were used to quantify the happiness of tweet language the use of labmt which ha shown strong prior performance in analyzing happiness on twitter is novel with respect to depression screening anew and liwc have been successfully applied in previous study on depression and twitter liwc wa also used to compile frequency count of various part of speech eg pronoun verb adjective and semantic category eg food word familial term profanity a additional predictorsdetermining the best time span for analysis raise a difficult question when and for how long doe mental illness occur receiving a clinical diagnosis of depression or ptsd doe not imply that an individual remains in a persistent state of illness and so to conduct analysis with an individual entire posting history a a single unit of observation is a dubious proposition at the other extreme to take one tweet a a unit of observation run the risk of being too granular de choudhury et al looked at all of a given user tweet in a single day and aggregated those data into perperson perday unit of observation in this report we have followed the convention of aggregated userdays a a primary unit of analysis rather than try to categorize a person entire history or analyze each individual tweet in our own previous research however we have found that many twitter user do not generate enough daily content to make for robust unigram sentiment analysis for completeness we conducted analysis using both daily and weekly unit of observation both analysis yielded predictive model of similar strength with the weekly model showing a slight but consistent edge in performance we report accuracy metric from both analysis but restrict other result to the dailyunit analysis to allow for more direct comparison with previous research detail of weeklyunit analytical result are available in supplementary information section ii when reporting result we occasionally refer to observation or tweet a depressed eg depressed tweet received fewer like it would be more correct to use the phrase tweet data from depressed participant aggregated by userdays instead of depressed tweet but we chose to sacrifice a degree of technical correctness for the sake of clarity
we used a dataset of nonclinical user who opted into a facebook application mypersonality kosinski and stillwell between june and march completed a item personality questionnaire an international personality item pool ipip proxy to the neopir goldberg and shared access to their status update containing at least word user wrote on average of word total word instance and a subset of user provided gender and age in which were female and the mean age wa the dataset wa divided into training and testing sample in particular the testing sample consisted of a random set of user who wrote at least word and completed the personality measure while the training set contained the remaining userswe estimated userlevel degree of depression ddep a the average response to seven depression facet item which are nested within the larger neuroticism item pool for each item user indicated how accurately short phrase described themselves eg often feel blue dislike myself response ranged from very inaccurate to very accurate figure a show the distribution of surveyassessed ddep standardized the item can be seen in table figure show the daily average of surveyassessed ddep collapsed across year a loess smoother over the daily average illustrates a seasonal trend with depression rising over the winter month and dropping during the summer
a clinical community community who are interested in depression and with at least post are extracted from livejournal this is identified through the search community by interest provided by livejournal and result in community with post the clinical community are grouped based on name and description of the individual community depression bipolar selfharm attachmentseparation and suicide see table for statistic the earliest community creation date wa in thus our data set span over year b control community we constructed a control data set using five popular category of community in the livejournal directory we select community who have at least post resulting in community with post this set is called control and the statistic of these community and their description are shown in table to characterize the difference between clinical and control community a variety of feature are extracted affective feature we use the lexiconaffective norm for english word anew to extract the sentiment conveyed in the content this lexicon consists of word rated in term of valence and arousal and is thus suitable for a quantitative estimation the valence of anew word is on a scale of very unpleasant to very pleasant the arousal is measured on the same scale least active to most active a cloud visualization of anew word used in the blog post made by clinical and control group is illustrated in fig mood tag livejournal provides a mechanism for user to tag their post from a list of predefined mood label thus in addition to the emotion expressed in the text of post the mood tag produced allows u direct access to the user sentiment a cloud visualization of mood tagged on blog post made by clinical and control community is llustrated in fig liwc feature we examine the proportion of word in psycholinguistic category a defined in the liwc package linguistic social affective cognitive perceptual biological relativity personal concern and spoken table present the mean of these liwc psycholinguistic process for the clinical and control community whilst similar in the use word with positive emotion people in the clinical community tend to use word with more negative emotionas example anxiety anger and sadness further they discus more issue about health and death in comparison with the control group on the other hand the user in the control group discus more neutral life related topicsingestion home and leisure word topic for extracting topic latent dirichlet allocation lda is used a a bayesian probabilistic modelling framework lda extract the probability that is word in a topic and then assigns a topic to each word in a document for the inference part we implemented gibbs inference detailed in we set the number of topic to run the gibbs for sample and use the last gibbs sample to interpret the result
a webbased survey of weibo user wa conducted to ass the respondent suicide risk and emotional distress ie depression anxiety and stress the invitation letter to participate in this survey wa widely sent out to general weibo user by various promotion activity for a weibo user to be eligible for the study she or he had to be year or older by selfreport a renminbi incentive for each complete survey wa provided to boost the respond rate with the respondent consent their weibo post that were posted in the public domain during the month before the survey were downloaded by calling weibo api the survey fulfilled the checklist for reporting result of internet esurveys cherry checklist and detail of the procedure have been reported in previous publication in addition when multiple survey feedback were submitted from the same internet protocol address only the first submission wa used to avoid duplicate participation in contrast to a previous study this study excluded those who posted nothing throughout the month but not those who posted fewer than post eventually data provided by respondent remained for further analysis the study ha obtained ethical approval from the human research ethical review committee at the university of hong kong and the institute review board of the institute of psychology at the chinese academy of science the survey measured respondent suicide probability score depression anxiety stress and weibo suicide communication wsc a the outcome variable in addition the respondent weibo post language feature were extracted a independent variable or feature for machine learning the detail of how those data were obtained are elaborated in the following subsection
we first obtained a list of ranked major university in the united state by crawling the u news and world report website this list is constructed based on the carnegie classification employed extensively by higher education researcher and using a set of indicator of academic excellence defined by u news the list includes a variety of university spread across the u in different setting eg urban rural and with a wide range of student enrollment size figure a show their geographic distribution a a part of this crawl we also obtained university metadata gender distribution of student average tuition and fee and academic calendar semesterquarter to obtain further information about the nature of the student body we crawled the wikipedia page of all of the university from these page we extracted the size of student enrollment type publicprivate and setting ruralsuburbanurbancity at every institution these definition come from a formal categorization scheme used by the u department of education the student body enrollment size ranged from to with public and private university university were reported to be urban city suburban and rural finally we obtained information on racial diversity of the university from a website known a priceonomics the website calculates the herfindahlhirschman index hhi by combining the raceethnicity distribution of student body at different university with data given from the department of education hhi range from the least diverse a population of all one type to n the most diverse where n is the number of different racial category being analyzed social medium data of university next we obtained social medium data of the above university specifically we focused on the social medium reddit why reddit reddit is known to be a widely used online forum and social medium site among the college student demographic due to it forum structure it is extensively used for both content sharing a well a for obtaining feedback and information from community of interest reddit harbor a variety of community known a subreddits including many dedicated to specific university campus this allows a large sample of post shared by student of a university to be collected in one place our preliminary manual inspection of university subreddits eg rgatech or rkstate revealed that these subreddits are appropriated by student to discus college topic table focusing on these public reddit community also doe not require explicit data collection effort to be coordinated at each of the university site although more student are likely to use facebook due to it largely privately shared content it is challenging to obtain access to a large dataset of a university student next while twitter is also widely adopted without explicit selfreported information it is challenging to identify college student account finally prior work note that semianonymity of reddit enables candid self disclosure around stigmatized topic like mental health initial data acquisition we leveraged the archive of all of reddit data made available on google bigquery bigquery is a cloud based managed data warehouse that allows third party to access large publicly available dataset through simple sqltype query our query grabbed all post ranging between june and february available in the reddit data archive this included post from unique user across all of the university with a mean of post and unique user per subreddit filling the gap in subreddit data the second step of our data collection process focused on identifying subreddits with insufficient data and supplementing them through additional alternative data collection through reddits official api httpswwwredditcomdevapi we obtained the most recent number of subscriber in the university subreddits a of july then to investigate if and to what extent some subreddits may have had unusually low data a given in step we determined the median unique user to subscriber ratio in each subreddit this allows u to capture the subreddits where the subscriber count is high however the data obtained is not sufficiently representative for subreddits with unique user to subscriber ratio under median in all we performed a onetime data collection using the reddit api this gave u a set of at most most recent post for each subreddit with a total of post added to the data obtained in step following deduplication we note that this procedure did not skew the yearly distribution of data across the subreddits the skew yearly rate of change before and after data filling were and respectively which were found to be statistically equivalent based on a twosample equivalence test p p a test that us two onesided ttests on the beforeafter yearly rate of change from both side of a chosen difference interval based on the reddit data we collected from figure b we observe high positive correlation between a university size of student body enrollment and the number of user subscribing to the corresponding subreddit r p for subreddits deviating from trend it would imply that the associated university student body wa under or overrepresented on reddit we therefore devised a method to identify these subreddits to correct especially for underadoption bias we first calculated the ratio between the number of subreddit subscriber to student enrollment for each subreddit and the corresponding university if for a subreddit this ratio wa le than the expected adoption of reddit for the same demographic group a of we assumed that reddit wa underadopted by the student in the corresponding university we thus removed subreddits where this ratio wa this brought down our subreddits from to in these subreddits the mean reddit adoption wa which is close to the highest adoption reported by pew the final dataset employed in our ensuing analysis included post from unique user mean post per subreddit mean user per subreddit figure a give a distribution of the volume of crawled post over the year figure b give the final distribution of subreddits over the unique user to subscriber count ratio figure cd give distribution of the post and unique user across the final subredditswe note it is possible that the type of student who frequent the university subreddits could be consistently different from the student body at the same university to examine the representativeness of our university subreddit data we employed a random sample of post distributed across the subreddits and the year for manual examination of demographic two researcher then independently coded these post for selfreported gender race or academic stage undergraduategraduate for instance from the post im a junior transfer and this will be my second semester the researcher identified the post author to be an undergraduate whereas from hi all im a new grad student male here the gender of the author can be inferred to be male we found the interrater agreement to be high cohens the relative ratio between the gender race and academic stage distribution of the coded post and the university student body obtained based on our methodology in the subsection university data showed significant positive correlation the mean undergradgrad ratio in our labeled data wa while it wa in the university a twosample test of equivalence gave pvalues of and respectively with respect to the difference interval the sex malefemale ratio for our labeled data wa also observed to be statistically equivalent to that of the student body p p wrt the difference interval this establishes the validity of our acquired reddit data a a representative data source for studying mental health disclosure in university campus
to train our model we require information from two different type of user patient and nonpatients therefore we employed a combined manual effort and keyword matching data collection approach to efficiently collect data for these user for the collection of patient we manually collect the community portal relevant to both mental disorder from these portal follower list we select the selfreported user who explicitly state in their profile description that they suffer from a mental illness ie for a given user we are checking if hisher profile contains any keyword related to a target disorder eg borderline bpd bipolar nonpatients are referred to a random active twitter user who are not explicitly stating that they are suffering from bipolar disorder hereinafter referred to a bd or borderline personality disorder hereinafter referred to a bpd to obtain these user we randomly sampled twitter id thereafter we proceeded to download the tweet from the selected id after the user have been identified we manually label them into one of two category patient a person who is suffering from a mental disorder notrelated any user who we dont consider to be a patient lastly after having obtained the final list of patient we retrieve their tweet these step are applied for the collection of both bpd and bd patient datasetsin this work we are focused on two main type of feature linguistic and behavioral tfidf is adopted to model the linguist feature of patient and pattern of life feature plf adopted from the work of coppersmith et al is used to model the behavioral style of patient tfidf feature to capture the frequent and representative word used by the patient tfidf is applied on the unigram and bigram collected from all the patient tweet pattern of life feature plf these feature reveal the emotional pattern and behavioral tendency of user by measuring polarity emotion and social interaction in order to fully compose the plf we combined the following list of feature age and gender twitter doe not publicly provide information about the age and gender of it user mainly due to privacy concern so we adopted the work of sap et al to fill in this information polarity feature the sentiment api wa used to label each tweet a either positive negative or neutral the polarity is furthermore transformed into five different value to capture the affective trait of each user positive ratio the percentage of positive tweet negative ratio the percentage of negative tweet positive combo capture the mania and hypomania trait of patient which is determined by the number of continuous positive post appearing more than x amount of time within a period of time in minute t negative combo capture the depression trait of patient and is determined by the number of continuous negative post appearing more than x amount of time within a period of time in minute t flip ratio quantifies the emotional unstableness and is determined by counting how frequently two continuous tweet with different polarity either positive to negative or negative to positive appear together within a period of time in minute t in our work x is set to and t is set to minute social feature these feature can demonstrate how user are behaving with respect to their environment the following are the social feature designed for each user tweeting frequency the frequency of daily post mention ratio the percentage of post which contain at least one mention of another user frequent mention the number of twitter user mentioned more than three time which is a measurement of how many close friend a particular user may have unique mention the number of unique user mentioned which is a measure of the width of a user social network
we developed six binary classification model each of which categorizes a user specific post into one of the following subreddits rdepression ranxiety rbipolar rbpd rschizophrenia and rautism our conjecture is that a user who suffers from a specific mental problem writes a post on the corresponding subreddit that deal with the problem a user can write post across multiple subreddits if heshe suffers from multiple mental health problem eg a user suffering from both depression and anxiety however if the model is trained with the post of user who have multiple symptom like a prior study the classification model may suffer from noisy data therefore we developed six independent binary classification model for each symptom to improve the performance by developing six independent model for each mental disorder each of which us data where user suffer from only one particular mental problem we were able to accurately identify a user potential mental state for example to develop a model for detecting depression we labeled the post written by user who upload post only in the rdepression a the depression class the opposite class is referred to a the nondepression class to address a classimbalance issue for the collected data we applied the synthetic minority oversampling technique smote algorithm we divided our dataset into training and testing set then xgboost and convolutional neural network cnn were employed morover we excluded the post of user who wrote post across multiple subreddits in learning phase to quantitatively represent each post we converted the word in the training set to numerical representation fig for the xgboost classifier we used the tfidf vectorizer in the sckitlearn package to convert word into ndimensional vector in the case of the cnn classifier we applied wordembedding procedure from the preprocessed text using the wordvec api of python package gensim the word vector were pretrained with the training dataset collected for the current study with continuous bagofwords representation cbow model while the size of window wa set to five note that by using the pretrained wordvec model for representing each post for each subreddit a language style used by user who write post in a subreddit can be trained for the specific subreddit an overview of the proposed cnnbased model is presented in fig the model architecture is organized by the sequence of layer that includes an embedding layer convolutional layer maxpooling layer dense layer and the output fig illustrates how a post is trained in the given model the first layer of the model is an embedding layer that represents the word embeddings of a preprocessed post with dimension and it weight is initialized by the pretrained wordvec second a convolutional layer with input of word vector ha filter and each filter size is five in addition we applied a dropout rate of to prevent overfitting issue the next layer is a maxpooling layer which take the maximum value within the cnn filter and it dimension is the output of the maxpooling layer is passed through two fully connected dense layer and the final output is the probability of the classification through the sigmoid activation function which range from to for training the neural network we used both the binary crossentropy loss function and adam optimizer with a learning rate of our model wa trained through epoch and the batch size wa set to
we build on prior work on supervised model for mental health inference over social medium data we focus on two mental health condition depression and ptsd and develop classifier with the selfreported datasets created for clpysch mitchell et al coppersmith et al b these labeled datasets derive from user that have publicly disclosed on twitter a diagnosis of depression user or ptsd user with an equal number of randomly selected demographicallymatched with respect to age and gender user a control for each user the associated metadata and posting history wa also collected up to the most recent tweet per limitation of the twitter api the participant of the task proposed a host of method ranging from rulebased system to various supervised model pedersen preotiucpietro et al coppersmith et al b more recently the neural userlevel classifier proposed by amir et al showed not only good performance on this task but also the ability to capture implicit similarity between user affected by the same disease thus opening the door to more interpretable analysis hence we adopt their model for this analysiswe constructed a cohort for our analysis by randomly selecting a sample of twitter user and processing it with the aforementioned demographic inference pipeline after discarding account from user located outside the united state we obtained a cohort of k twitter user with the demographic composition shown in figure some demographic group are overrepresented eg young adult while others are grossly underrepresented eg teenager which illustrates the need for methodology that can take these disparity into account we then processed the cohort through the mentalhealth classifier to estimate the prevalence of depression and ptsd and examine how these illness manifest across the population the analysis revealed that of the cohort member are likely to suffer from depression from ptsd and from both we observe a significant overlap between people affected by depression and ptsd which is not surprising given that the comorbidity of these disorder is wellknown with approximately half of people with ptsd also having a diagnosis of major depressive disorder flory and yehuda how do these condition affect different part of the population to answer this question we looked at the affected user and measured how the demographic of individual subpopulation differ from those of the cohort a a whole figure and show the estimate for depression ptsd and both controlled for the cohort demographic we observe large generational difference ptsd seems to be more prevalent among older people whereas depression affect predominantly younger people we also observe that in all case woman are more susceptible than men and black and hispanic are more likely to be affected than white this may represent a bias in the underlying data used to construct the classifier or a difference in how social medium is used by different demographic group for example model that were trained with a majority of data from white user maybe oversensitive to specific dialect used by other community
we analyze two datasets user community on reddit and journal from a mental health journalling mobile app we omit the name of the app for privacy and we refer to it a the journalling app reddit is a social medium platform that wa originally used for sharing and rating content such a news documentary and music user post in and subscribe to selforganized community known a subreddits subscribing to a subreddit allows a user to view all post from that subreddit an advantage of analyzing reddit data is that the subreddits are labelled according to their topic utilizing curated list from volunteer reddit user we crawled all subreddits related to mental health a well a all subreddits linked by these community the second dataset consists of anonymized journal post from a mobile app designed to help people track their mood and share them anonymously if they desire for each journal post the app requires the user to label the journal post with at least one mood selected from a prepopulated list including happy sad etc we obtained all journal and the associated mood written between january and january this amount to over million journal written by approximately user figure plot the number of journal posted over time most of the journal were written in the first half of although we inspected topic distribution per month and did not find seasonal effect towards the beginning of many new user registered on the app and eventually stopped using it like weightloss and productivity apps we believe this influx is tied to user looking to improve their habit a a new year resolution each journal can be set to be private or public visible to all other user of the app roughly one third of all journal are public figure plot the number of user on the yaxis versus the percentage of journal they posted publicly most user are either mostly private or mostly public most journal are relatively short just like twitter post that are at most character the average length of a journal with text in it is character there are roughly journal that have no text only a mood label we observed that private user tend to write journal that are slightly but statistically significantly longer than those written by public user by approximately character figure show the distribution of journal length where the spike correspond to length mood only character the default limit set by the app and character set a the maximum for visualization purpose user of the app can optionally enter their location age and gender while most user did not enter this information we found that those who revealed their location are mostly from north america those who revealed their gender are predominantly female and those who revealed their age have an average age of the goal of this analysis is to understand public mental health by mining social medium we want to identify common topic discussed publicly reddit plus public journal from the journalling app and privately private journal for the reddit dataset we simply count the number of subscriber in each subreddit related to mental health to discover popular topic and issue recall that each subreddit is labelled with it topic so topic modelling is not necessary on the other hand for the journalling app each journal post is labelled with a mood but not with a topic below we describe our methodology for assigning topic to journal
a key challenge of this research wa to identify the different health condition on which people seek and share information via search engine and twitter respectively we identified four broad category of condition based on their severity and type symptom of major disease benign explanation nonlifethreatening illness serious illness and disability we also characterized each condition by the degree of perceived social stigma provided by thirdparty judge our final list contained condition
reddit is a social news website where registered user submit content in the form of link or text post user also known a redditors can then vote each submission up or down to rank the post and determine it position or prominence on the site page these two attribute associated with a post are referred to a upvotes and downvotes redditors can also comment on post and respond back in a conversation tree of comment content entry that is the post are organized by area of interest or subcommunities called subreddits such a politics programming or science a of reddits official statistic included billion page view million unique visitor post and comment httpblogredditcom toppostsofstatsandsnooyearshtml we used of reddits official api httpwwwredditcom dev api to collect post comment and associated metadata from several mental health subreddits specifically using a python wrapper praw httpsprawreadthedocsorgen latestindexhtml the subreddits we crawled were alcoholism anxiety bipolarreddit depression mentalhealth mmfb make me feel better socialanxiety suicidewatch all of these subreddits host public content in order to arrive at a comprehensive list of subreddits to focus on we utilized reddits native subreddit search feature httpwwwredditcomreddits and searched for subreddits on mental health two researcher familiar with reddit employed an initial filtering step on the search result returned so that we focus on high precision subreddits discussing mental health concern and issue thereafter we focused on a snowball approach in which starting with a few seed subreddits mentalhealth depression we compiled a second list of related or similar subreddits that are listed in the profile page of the seed subreddits following a second filtering step we arrived at the list of subreddits listed above for each of these subreddits we obtained daily crawl of their post in the new category corresponding to each post we collected information on the title of the post the body or textual content id timestamp when the post wa made author id and the number of upvotes and downvotes it obtained since post gather comment over a period of time following the time of sharing we crawled all of the comment per post that were shared over a three day period after the post wa made qualitative examination of the subreddits of interest revealed that or more of the comment to any post were typically made in a three day window following the time the post is madehence the choice the crawl of the subreddits used in this paper we present some descriptive statistic of our crawled data our dataset contained post with at least one comment and comment in all with unique user who made post comment or both a set of user were found to write both at least one post and comment cdf of the user distribution over post and comment is given in figure the figure show the expected heavy tail trend observed in several social phenomenon also see figure for the distribution of comment over time following post share it illustrates the quick responsivity culture in the community we study peak at hour some of the additional statistic of our dataset are given in table further example title of a few
we acknowledge that there are some limitation to our work a the analysis and the inference obtained are purely data driven and relied on public post shared on instagram around mental health challenge specifically to obtain disclosure of mental health issue we utilized tag attached to post we presume selfselection bias in user who make public post and link them to different mental health hashtags we caution against applying our method to arbitrary context moreover although user might be voluntarily relating themselves to one of the mental health disorder category it is unclear to what extent this constitutes an online identity construction activity importantly it is challenging to ass the gravity of a given user health condition using these post or image alone or more specifically if they are actually experiencing a clinical mental health concern on a related note although the tag we employed for obtaining our mental health data were verified through consultation with a licensed psychiatrist we do not claim our method reveal symptom or diagnostic marker of mental illness in individual therefore the method we developed in this paper were not evaluated for their effectiveness in discovering mental health concern but rather a a principled and quantifiable way to understand the nature of mental health disclosure shared on social medium putting it together our finding should not be interpreted to be diagnostic claim about one mental health to do so we advocate for collaboration between clinician and hci researcher along with voluntarily consenting patient this constitutes one of our future research direction finally qualitative method would lend a deeper understanding of the motivation behind appropriating a public social medium outlet for vulnerable and sensitive exchange we also emphasize that the analyzed visual and linguistic pattern on instagram are not the only pattern that can help study selfdisclosure indeed current advancement in machine learning approach like deep learning have created a new thread of research in image classification where image classification problem once difficult to solve can now be solved very efficiently we believe such method can be incorporated to study mental health imagery shared on social medium
tweet about depression were collected by simply measured a company that specializes in social medium measurement and analytics simply measured simply measured ha access to the twitter firehose or full volume of tweet via gnip a licensed company that can retrieve the full twitter data stream all tweet in the english language that contained at least either depressed depressed depression or depression were collected between april and may we scanned a random sample of the tweet to identify common phrase that included our keywords of interest but were not about mental health in sa version sa institute inc cary nc we used the index function which search a character expression in this case the text of the tweet for a specific string of character to locate and remove such tweet from our sample we removed tweet that included the following term regardless of capitalization great depression economic depression during the depression depression era tropical depression and depressed real estate the popularity and influence of the tweeter wa described using the distribution of follower and klout score while number of follower is a measure of popularity klout score is a measure of influence klout score range from to with a higher score indicating higher influence klout score is calculated based on an algorithm that considers over signal from eight different online network example of signal include the amount of retweets a person generates in relation to the amount of tweet shared and the amount of engagement a user drive from unique individual eg lot of retweets from different individual a opposed to lot of retweets from one person klout inc using the sa surveyselect procedure we selected a simple random sample of tweet that were not direct reply from the total volume of depressionrelated tweet two member of the research team each with graduate level degree ie phd and mph and more than year of experience in mental health research scanned approximately random tweet in order to determine their most common theme and generate a codebook we defined theme a topic that occur and reoccur ryan bernard tweet were coded for presence of the following theme tweeter discloses feeling of depression tweet is a supportive or helpful message about depression tweeter discloses feeling school or workrelated pressure related to depression tweeter engages in substance use to deal with depression and tweeter discloses selfharm or suicidal thought tweet could be assigned a many theme a were pertinent for tweet where the user indicated that he or she wa feeling depressed those that appeared trivial ie not concerning were identified these were tweet where the depression term were used casually or in a humorous manner or referenced depression caused by trivial thing such a being depressed after finishing a good book seeing a concert or watching a sad movie in addition we ascertained the source of the tweet by viewing the tweeter profile picture and studying their twitter handle name the source wa then coded into one of the three following category cliniciantherapist healthfocused handle eg healthgovernment organization handle focused on healthy lifestyle etc or regular person or other handle did not fall into the above category using this codebook the randomly sampled tweet were coded in team of two trained student research intern who coded the tweet together discussing each tweet and coming to an agreement on the final assigned code a sample of tweet wa also coded by a senior team member phd clinician with extensive mental health research experience intercoder reliability for each theme wa a follows tweeter discloses feeling of depression percent agreement kappa tweet is a supportive or helpful message about depression percent agreement kappa tweeter discloses feeling school or workrelated pressure related to depression percent agreement kappa tweeter engages in substance use to deal with depression percent agreement kappa tweeter discloses selfharm or suicidal thought percent agreement kappa trivial disclosure of depression percent agreement kappa source of tweet percent agreement kappa because both prevalence of and kappa for diminished ability to thinkconcentrate were low we chose not to report on this codedemographics pro wa used to infer the demographic characteristic of the individual who disclosed feeling depressed in the tweet that were examined in the present study demographic pro for twitter the demographic characteristic examined include age gender raceethnicity marital status income occupation and location of the tweeter in order to ass for pattern in twitter interest the most likely twitter handle that are being followed by the tweeter were also provided demographic pro us a series of proprietary algorithm to estimate or infer likely demographic characteristic of twitter handle based on twitter behaviorusage their prediction rely on multiple data signal from network signal imparted by the nature and strength of tie between individual on twitter consumption consumption of information on twitter revealed by account followed and realworld consumption revealed by twitter usage and language word and phrased used in tweet and bios demographic pro ha used their methodology to profile some million twitter user to date and requires confidence of or above to make an estimate of a single demographic characteristic for example if prediction are made would need to be correct in order to accept the methodology used to make the prediction the success of the demographic pro analytic prediction relies on the relatively low covariance of multiple amplified signal iterative evaluation testing the methodology on training set of established sample of twitter user with verified demographic allows the calibration of balance between depth of coverage the number of demographic prediction made and required accuracy the size of these established sample of twitter user with verified demographic varies from to people depending on the specific demographic characteristic to be inferred for comparison purpose inferred demographic characteristic across a sample of randomly selected englishlanguage twitter user in the u and canada were also provided by demographic pro we used pearson chi square test to compare the inferred characteristic of tweeter from our sample who expressed feeling of depression versus the typical twitter user p wa considered statistically significant
we follow the data acquisition and curation process of coppersmith et al a summarizing the major point here social medium such a twitter contains frequent public statement by user reporting diagnosis for various medical condition many talk about physical health condition eg cancer flu but some also discus mental illness including schizophrenia there are a variety of motivation for user to share this information on social medium to offer or seek support to fight the stigma of mental illness or perhaps to offer an explanation for certain behavior we obtain message with these selfreported diagnosis using the twitter api and filtered via caseinsensitive regular expression to require schizo or a close phonetic approximation to be present our expression matched schizophrenia it subtypes and various approximation schizo skitzo skitso schizotypal schizoid etc all data we collect are public post made between and and exclude any message marked a private by the author all use of the data reported in this paper ha been approved by the appropriate institutional review board irb each selfstated diagnosis included in this study wa examined by a human annotator one of the author to verify that it appeared to be a genuine statement of a schizophrenia diagnosis excluding joke quote or disingenuous statement we obtained user with an apparently genuine selfstated diagnosis of a schizophreniarelated condition note that we cannot be certain that the twitter user wa actually diagnosed with schizophrenia only that their statement of being diagnosed appears to be genuine previous work indicates that interannotator agreement for this task is good coppersmith et al a for each user we obtained a set of their public twitter post via the twitter api collecting up to tweet a we wish to focus on userauthored content we exclude from analysis all retweets and any tweet that contain a url which often contain text that the user did not author we lowercase all word and convert any nonstandard character including emoji to a systematic ascii representation via unidecode for our community control we used randomlyselected twitter user who primarily tweet in english specifically during a two week period in early each twitter user who wa included in twitter spritzer sample had an equal chance for inclusion in our pool of community control we then collected some of their historic tweet and assessed the language they tweeted in according to the chromium compact language detector user were excluded from our community control if their tweet were le than englishwe use a balanced dataset here for our analysis an equal number of schizophrenia user and community control this split make the machine learning and analysis easier and will allow u to focus more on emergent linguistics that are related to schizophrenia than if we had examined a dataset more representative of the population more like moreover we have not factored in the cost of false negative or false positive how should the consequence of misclassifying a schizophrenia user a nonschizophrenic be weighed against the consequence of misclassifying a nonschizophrenic user a schizophrenic all our classification result should be taken a validation that the difference in language we observe are relevant to schizophrenia but only one step towards applying something derived from this technology in a real world scenariooften people suffering from mental illness have a diagnosis for more than one disorder and schizophrenia is no exception of our user with a genuine selfstatement of diagnosis of a schizophreniarelated condition also state a diagnosis of at least one other mental illness while of those state that they have a diagnosis of more than one other mental illness the vast majority of these concomitance are with bipolar user followed by depression post traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder these comorbidity rate are notably lower than the generally accepted prevalence rate which may be due to one of several factor first we rely on stated diagnosis to calculate comorbidity and the user may not be stating each of their diagnosed condition either because they have not been diagnosed a such or they choose to identify most strongly with the stated diagnosed condition or they simply ran out of space given twitter character limit second we are analyzing twitter user which consists of only a subset of the population and the user that choose to state publicly on twitter their schizophrenia diagnosis may not be an accurate representation of the population of schizophrenia sufferer the noted concomitance of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is frequently labeled a schizoaffective disorder with a bipolar subtype with some recent research indicating shared impairment in functional connectivity across patient with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder meda et al it is worth keeping in mind throughout this paper that we examine all subtypes of schizophrenia together here and further indepth analysis between subtypes is warranted
next we compiled a list of reported celebrity suicide which fell within the time range of our reddit data defining who is a celebrity is nontrivial so we refer to the wikipedia page listing celebrity suicide a a way to measure who ha sufficient celebrity status for inclusion we obtained reported celebrity suicide in the same period a our reddit data their name and reported suicide are shown in table we measure the prominence of a celebrity death by measuring the change in wikipedia page view for the celebrity wikipedia page wikipedia provides daily page view statistic for each page we compare the number of pageviews in the two week prior to their death with the two week following their death in term of zscore figure here zscores are computed by converting the page view to standard normal variable with mean and standard deviation of for of the case we see a notable spike in number of view showing that the suicide of these individual were wellknown enough to be viewable on such a macro scale and for examining the presence of werther effect in social medium we note two aspect related to the above analysis and which will be used through the rest of this paper first since we are focusing on different type of data sourceswikipedia and reddit we use zscore conversion a a normalization technique for the wikipedia page view and reddits sw posting activity volume further the above observation in wikipedia data and the analysis that ensue focus on observing change over a two week window preceding and succeeding a celebrity suicide this choice is motivated by our initial analysis and from the literature on werther effect
all of the following analysis is subject to a few caveat emergent from the data and how the data were collected the user with mental health condition are all found data of one sort or another so there are some inherent bias we prefer to express these bias rather than add complexity by attempting to cleverly correct for them many of these user talk publicly about their mental health which given the stigma and discrimination they face is likely a distinct subpopulation of those with mental health condition it is possible that user with a psychological disorder or suicide history who did not publicly disclose this information could have been included in the control group for analysis which may have the effect of artificially lowering the estimated power of any emergent difference user who donated data through ourdatahelpsorg are likely biased differently with over representation of altruism since they are willing to do thing for the public good without any obvious self gain another consideration is that all user who reported a suicide attempt within our dataset survived there is a possibility that characteristic difference also exist between individual who do and do not die by a suicide attempt note that this research wa conducted on englishspeaking social medium user the content of social medium post micropatterns for psychological disorder and suicidality could differ between cultural context due to difference in crosscultural expression of mental illness chentsovadutton et al these are active twitter user which imparts a demographic skew compared to the rest of the world in particular these user skew young we see more female in our user population than the rough gender balance observed for general twitter user greenwood et al the language data itself is meant for public consumption and may reflect how the author wish to be perceived and not what one would get from a more traditional journal study of internal and private thought and feeling finally we include user who had a concomittant or comorbid mental health condition thus a small number of user appear in more than one category
we note that the population of the four country are widely different along with their overall reported internet penetration rate hence we devise a subsampling strategy to filter user belonging to one of the four country from the set of user in the candidate disclosure and the control datasets with inferrable country information first for population based subsampling we use the inverse of the population rank of the country a the respective rate of sampling then we use the internet penetration percentage of the country to randomly sample that fraction of user from the population subsampled set in this manner across both the datasets we obtained twitter user from the u user from the uk from in and from zanext we also note that it is possible that our candidate control dataset includes user who engage in mental illness in their post however did not use any of the keyphrases from table to eliminate such user like above we compare the language used in the twitter post of these user with that of the reddit mental health post however in this case we are interested in the user whose language is most distinct or least similar from that used in the reddit content hence our final control dataset is obtained by filtering for those user whose language model based similarity is le than the median similarity across all control user vector user median distance see figure b for a distribution of the cosine cosine similarity we will refer to this dataset a ctl user ref figure for the approach
the selection of the tweet and their user wa based on the filtered realtime streaming support provided by the twitter api in the first step we selected the user who showed potential sign of depression on twitter on the basis of the most frequent word in spanish expressed by patient suffering from depression in clinical setting these word were jointly identified and selected by a psychologist and a family physician with clinical experience and were based on the definition and general feature of depression according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder the list of word used and their english translation are shown in textbox during june tweet including or more occurrence of the word listed in textbox were collected from this collection of tweet and to select the user who publicly stated in the textual description associated to their profile that they suffered from depression all the profile description including or more occurrence of the word depr and all the possible derivation related to the word depression in spanish such a depre depresin depresivo depresiva deprimido and deprimida were considered from the user who included or more of these word in their description profile user who stated they suffered from depression or were receiving treatment for depression were selected for the analysis this selection wa performed by a psychologist verifying that the statement were related to real expression of depression excluding quote joke or fake one for each of these depressed twitter user we collected all the most recent tweet from their timeline up to a maximum of about tweet thus a total of tweet were collected a figure that wa reduced to after discarding the retweets these tweet constituted the depressive user dataset example of sentence appearing in the user profile that were used for selecting the depressive user are paciente psiquitrico con depresin crnica psychiatric patient with chronic depression example of a profile sentence that indicates depression colecciono errores traducidos a tweet depresivos y a uno que otro impulso de amor i gather error translated into depressing tweet and into one or another love impulse example of a profile sentence that doe not indicate depression once the user with profile sentence indicating depression had been retrieved their twitter timeline were collected only those user having in their timeline at least tweet that suggested sign of depression were retained for further analysis for each user the selection of these tweet wa performed by manually inspecting the tweet of the user complete timeline in reverse temporal order starting from the most recent one to the oldest tweet of the timeline retrieved by mean of the twitter api finally a total number of tweet issued by the depressive user suggesting sign of depression were detected and used for the analysis this set of tweet provided u with the depressive tweet dataset which wa used to analyze linguistic feature of tweet showing sign of depression it ha to be mentioned that these tweet were not to be included in the depressive user dataset see figure at the same time more than tweet were also collected in june such tweet were gathered by listening to the public twitter stream during this time span by only considering tweet with spanish textual content a detected by twitter language identification support given that twitter requires more restrictive filter than just the language of the tweet we used a list of the most frequently used spanish word stopwords to retrieve all tweet that included or more of these word the vast majority of spanish tweet should match this criterion a sample of user who did not mention in their profile the word depression and it derivation were selected randomly from the tweet the complete timeline of these user were compiled tweet which were reduced to once retweets were removed these tweet constituted the control dataset to identify the language of a tweet we relied on the language automatically identified by twitter for each tweet selecting tweet in spanish it ha to be noted that these data can contain some tweet from unidentified depressive user
data wa collected from cup of tea an anonymous online chatbased peer support community for emotional distress user agree at signup that their data may be used for the purpose of research all the data used for the current study wa anonymous and securely stored this research wa performed in line with the ethical and privacy protocol outlined in detail in benton et al data from cup take the form of written dialogue between user of the service and volunteer who are trained a active listener a fragment of an exchange between the user of the service u and the volunteer v might go a follows for the analysis reported in this paper we used only text generated by user of the service not the volunteer providing peer support user who reported depression a their primary concern at sign up were eligible for inclusion in analysis our original sample wa comprised of conversation involving unique user user were excluded from the sample if they did not indicate their culture or if they selected other this resulted in the exclusion of and user respectively the original sample also included user identifying a native american or american indian this group wa excluded from analysis since the majority of the data among these user wa not english this resulted in the removal of user leaving a total sample size of user of the service completed a questionnaire at signup in which they provided information about their demographic characteristic and mental health demographic characteristic assessed included age gender and ethnicity ethnicity response category were white asian or pacific islander black or african american latino or hispanic native american or american indian or other user could only select one ethnic group category user also select the primary reason for using cup and the user above all indicated a primary purpose of depression
selection criterion and data scope to understand the impact of cultural difference on how individual use online mental health platform we begin our analysis by creating a dataset of user from different national community on talklife a support platform with over half a million user for this analysis due to the fact that most research in cscw on mental health online ha been done either agnostic of cultural context or in a western context we choose to focus on user from nonwestern country following zhang et al a researcher located in the global south and with lived experience interacting with the health system and diverse explanatory model of mental illness we believe that moving the focus of cscw and cscwadjacent mental health research away from the west is crucial to better meet the need of people often underserved by the medical system to create these subgroup of user we choose the three nonwestern country with the highest user population on talklife or india malaysia and the philippine guided by the rich amount of literature on the unique nuance to mental health expression for each country we examine the national identity linguistic and behaviorbased difference of use between each user subgroup in particular this research note that a a result of cultural norm around the sharing of distress and alternative conceptualization of mental illness in india malaysia and the philippine symptom are often expressed in somatic and religious term a opposed to traditionally clinical or psychiatric term we choose to analyze each subgroup at the national level for both theoretical and practical reason on a theoretical level in past work in the medical anthropology of mental health national identity ha commonly been used for a approximate level of analysis for cultural identity additionally on a more practical level each user country wa determined using their ip address by talklife and shared with u in an useranonymized dataset inferring a more precise location could potentially compromise user anonymity a discussed in past work and did not seem to have any more significant value for our analysis of cultural difference than analysis at the national level we analyze data from indian user malaysian user and filipino user a shown in table collectively we refer to these country a the minority sample a a comparison set we construct a random sample of all thread on talklife and refer to it a the majority sample due to the relative prevalence of user from western englishspeaking country in talklife most of the thread in the majority sample include post from country such a the usa uk and canada indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on talklife data wa sampled from may to june following this crossnational analysis to see if our broader result on talklife generalize to a differently structured online mental health community we picked the largest western country the united state and the largest nonwestern country india represented on cup a similar support platform with more than user actively using the platform each week using cup data we repeat our analysis testing for the same cultural difference we found in our talklife sample for this analysis we were provided a sample of data on activity from indian user and american user a shown in table unlike our sample of talklife user this dataset is not a random sample there is an upsampling of indian user to ensure that we have data from a sufficient number of indian in the dataset like on talklife indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on cup we focus on indian user due to a lack of sufficient data on user from malaysia or the philippine data wa sampled from march august defining cultural identity and use of clinical language in this work we examine the relationship between cultural identity and use of online mental health support forum to do so we leverage tomlinsons definition of cultural identity a self and communal definition based around specific usually politically inflected differentiation gender sexuality class religion race and ethnicity nationality particularly looking at the aspect that of modern cultural identity that run along national line a delineated by hall et al a a diverse and amorphous form of identity cultural identity can often intersect and interact with other form of identity including religious or ethnic identity however in the absence of direct information about religious or ethnic identity based on the data available we use national identity a a proxy for cultural identity additionally following schlesinger et al call for more intersectional analysis and method within hci we also include analysis of adjacent and intersecting identity when relevant including religious identity to analyze clinical language we use a broader definition of clinical language than just specific medical diagnosis following method used in past work to analyze antidepressant related language we create a dataset of clinical mental health language including unigrams bigram and trigram from a list of mental disorder a defined by the international classification of disease icd and diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder dsm we also included all unigrams from the macmillan dictionary list of word used to describe illness and disease both specifically for mental illness and general illness a a result we include unigrams like night from night terror or sleep from sleep disorder a these are often correlated with specific symptom of mental illness or distress such a sleep issue or being awake at night this included any clinically common abbreviation for mental disorder such a ocd for obsessive compulsive disorder or bpd for borderline personality disorder shorthand for disorder commonly used by online community such a proana a used in proeating disorder community were not included due to the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of these term across disorder we choose to use term from and associated with dsm and icd categorized disorder a a result of the common usage of these framework globally throughout our analysis of these varied factor we use to represent mean and to represent standard deviation constraint limitation and tradeoff cultural identity can exist at many different and intersecting level including subculture and subcommunities within the larger umbrella of a cultural identity a a result for the purpose of this analysis we had to adopt some constraint in order to do a meaningful and specific analysis one large limiting constraint that we chose for this study is to use national identity at the state level a a proxy for cultural identity though a major and formative part of modern cultural identity a argued by both hall and tomlinson each country we analyze is incredibly diverse with many individual cultural identity that both intersect and diverge from a greater national identity a more rich analysis of these other form of cultural identity is beyond the scope of this work but could lead to richer conclusion about the nature of cultural identity in online mental health support community particularly with regard to cultural difference between user with the same national identity additionally to stay consistent between analysis a a result of a lack of data on user from malaysia and the philippine we only analyze user in india on cup and extend these finding to the experience of being part of a minority group on an online mental health forum we draw validity for these exploratory finding from similar consistent pattern we observe between indian malaysian and filipino user but a deeper analysis with a larger dataset is likely necessary to determine when and for which minority community these conclusion do not hold true additionally while we construct clinical language through use of the commonly used dsm and icd both framework of illness categorization have significant limitation particularly in the country we have selected for example there are both mental health disorder that are culturebound a well a mental health language that is used in different way within the specific country we analyze such a depression often being an umbrella term for all mental illness additionally it is clear that online support community often develop their own cultural norm and language around mental health and a deeper understanding of how this play out on talklife and cup is neither the focus nor within the scope of this work in this work we intentionally use standard clinical and medical term for mental health disorder in our analysis of clinical language a detailed in past anthropological research it is theorized that the use of medical and clinical language is representative of a medicalized explanatory model of illness and we frame use of this language across culture a a approximate signifier of a greater awareness of the presence of a mental disorder a opposed to conceptualizing distress a stress tension or depression for our analysis we strictly analyzed post that were in the latin alphabet with almost all post on both talklife and cup being in english however a both malay and tagalog are most commonly written in the latin script and since it is common for user from india speaker to use romanized version of indian language online it is possible that a small minority of post in our analysis were text in a different language however a confirmed by only seeing english word used in our analysis of the top ngrams among each user subgroup it is clear that english is the predominant language on both platform though beyond the immediate scope of this work a greater analysis of nonenglish codeswitching on these platform could lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of interaction on expression between user with the same national identity but different language preference
in this section we first present the data gathered and used in our analysis researcher interested in the code and the data are invited to contact the author reddit is a website which enables user to aggregate rate and discus news entertainment politics and many other topic according to alexa it is the th most popular website in the world it wa estimated by the pew research center that of online adult use reddit the site is organized into a collection of subreddits each focused on a particular topic and administered by a collection of moderator the subreddit rsuicidewatch is a forum in which online user are encouraged to post their thought regarding suicide at the time of our data collection it had over subscriber sometimes user express a preoccupation with the thought of suicide other time user discus immediate plan to take their own life these post often contain a description of their mental state including depression reaction to stress their feeling of being alone and having a low selfesteem while most online source of data are notoriously noisy this particular subreddit is remarkably clean given the serious nature of the subreddit individual are le likely to post harassing comment or offtopic remark when user post such comment the moderator of the subreddit quickly remove them we collected all post from it inception in to each post is often commented on by other individual in this work we focused on the original post a it most often represents the suicidal ideation of a user and comment often represent emotional support from other user we cleaned this data first we removed empty post in which the content had been deleted second we removed link and replaced them with the word link third we concatenated the text of the post to the title a many user begin their post in the title and continue in the body of the post finally we removed punctuation and other special character after cleaning this data we had post with word of which word were unique posted by unique user
reddit is a multilingual online social network founded in and organized in subcommunities by area of interest called subreddits we obtained data from the reddits data repository focusing on four subreddits where people discus issue related to mental heath disorder depression rdepression suicide watch rsuicide watch anxiety ranxiety and bipolar rbipolar our dataset is comprised of user activity post and comment that took place between and here we focus on data from january to december in total we obtained post and comment from unique user table i show the total number of user post and comment per subreddit the total number of comment in each community is at least time larger than the number of post which suggests a supportive behavior among userswe model user interaction a a weighted directed graph g where each node represents a user each directed edge u v indicates that user u commented on one or more post made by user v and the edge weight is equal to the number of u comment summed over all v post given a user u in g the indegree of u is the number of user who interact with user u ie the number of unique user who commented on post from u the outdegree of u in turn is the number of interaction u had within the community ie the number of post u commented on social support is the process of interaction in relationship which improves coping esteem belonging and competence through actual or perceived exchange of psychosocial resource adapted from in addition to measuring support from the interaction graph we also measure it from discussion tree in a discussion tree the root node corresponds to a post while other node correspond to comment made either in response to the post or to other comment in the same thread analyzing tree size depth and shape width can shed some light on the topic that most attract user attention a well a pinpoint key member in each community for instance a highly emotional comment can trigger more reaction than the original post ie the majority of the discussion might be concentrated in one of the branchesrmn is a recursive neural network designed to model relationship between pair of entity from text each relationship is represented at a given point in time a a vector of weight over k descriptor entity that form a relationship do not need to be of the same class for example in this work we model the relationship between a user and the community in which she interacts each post or comment corresponds to a different instant word are represented a embeddings of dimension p that is each word w of a vocabulary v is a vector in rp user and community are represented by embeddings of dimension u and c respectively a in previous work we generated embeddings using glove the descriptor obtained from rmn are vector in rp allowing u to find the closest word to each descriptor the post or comment representation is denoted by vpost rp this vector is the average of the word embeddings contained in the post the representation of user and community are denoted by vuser and vcomm for each post or comment rmn take a input a vector v rp uc obtained by concatenating vpost vuser and vcomm these vector are combined through the weight of the neural network to obtain a representation dt rk of the relationship between the user and the community at that particular time rmn us a smoothing parameter to avoid abrupt change in the representation of the same relation in consecutive instant dt and dt the descriptor array r rkp is used for attempting to reconstruct the post vpost by making rt rdt rmn parameter weight and matrix of descriptor are trained in order to maximize an objective function that aim to approximate rt and vpost while retaining some distance between rt and other randomly sampled post see for more detail on rmn the input data for rmn wa preprocessed a follows first we removed all post and comment marked a deleted or removed standard stopwords using the nltk library punctuation and accent second for each subreddit we removed post and comment from user who performed le than activity post or comment following the methodology presented in finally we selected the word that appear at least once in each of the four subreddits analyzed seeking to find similarity in the way people express themselves when discussing mental health disorder the final subset of data analyzed by rmn is composed of unique word post and comment
