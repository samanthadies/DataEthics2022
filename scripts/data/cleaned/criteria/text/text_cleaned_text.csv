several different type of information were extracted from the collected instagram data we used total post per user per day a a measure of user activity we gauged community reaction by counting the number of comment and like each posted photograph received face detection software wa used to determine whether or not a photograph contained a human face a well a count the total number of face in each photo a a proxy measure for participant social activity level pixellevel average were computed for hue saturation and value hsv three color property commonly used in image analysis hue describes an image coloring on the light spectrum ranging from red to bluepurple lower hue value indicate more red and higher hue value indicate more blue saturation refers to the vividness of an image low saturation make an image appear grey and faded value refers to image brightness lower brightness score indicate a darker image see figure for a comparison of high and low hsv value we also checked metadata to ass whether an instagramprovided filter wa applied to alter the appearance of a photograph collectively these measure served a the feature set in our primary model for the separate model fit on rating data we used only the four rating category happy sad likable interesting a predictor
our first set of method include developing three set of measure spanning linguistic structure interpersonal awareness and interaction the choice of these measure is motivated by literature that examines association between the behavioral expression of individual and their response to crisis including vulnerability due to mental illness each of these measure category consists of the following variable linguistic structure for this measure we compute the fraction of noun verb and adverb in post and comment automated readability index a measure to gauge the understandability of text and linguistic accommodation a process by which individual in a conversation adjust their language style according to that of others together these variable characterize the text shared by the user class beyond their informational content per literature in psycholinguistics such structure is known to relate to an individual underlying psychological and cognitive state and can reveal cue about their social coordination interpersonal awareness this measure category includes proportion of first person singular indicating preoccupation with self first person plural indicating collective attention second person and third person pronoun indicating social interactivity and reference to people or object in the environment literature ha indicated that pronoun use can quantify an individual self and social awareness and can reveal mental wellbeing including that manifested in social medium interaction variable corresponding to this measure category include volume of post and comment authored post length length of comment authored volume of comment received on shared post length of comment received mean vote difference difference between upvotes and downvotes on post authored and response velocity in minute given by the time elapsed between the first comment and the time the corresponding post wa shared
based on the training data thus created we pursued the use of supervised learning to develop a classifier which would indicate whether a post is of high low or no selfdisclosure we tested a variety of different classification technique decision tree k nearest neighbor naive bayes the best performing classifier wa found to be a perceptron classifier with adaptive boosting used to amplify performance whose result will be used in the remainder of this paper we used the following feature generation rule first we eliminated stopwords from each post based on standard list provided by python nltk library next we performed stemming using porter stemmer we extracted uni bi and trigram from each post and considered those with five or more occurrence we also computed two additional feature length of each post and whether the author of the post is an exclusive poster on mental health forum or is observed in our dataset to post on other forum a well thus each post wa characterized by feature we used standard fold cross validation cv to evaluate the classifier and ran our model over random fold cv assignment for generalizability of the result we report the average accuracy precision recall f specificity a metric of performance we find that our classifier based on the perception model yield an average accuracy of in detecting high or low selfdisclosure with precision and recall see table for detail other method like knn k give higher precision but at the expense of very low recall figure give the roc receiver operating characteristic curve for all the model per the roc curve corresponding to the perceptron model we find it to yield the maximum area under curve hence best performance we further identify in table the ngrams or feature with the highest weight given by the perceptron it implies these feature were the most significant in the classification task we provide some brief qualitative examination of these ngrams in the light of prior psychology literature on selfdisclosure and mental health we find that the ngrams primarily are associated with vulnerable and selfloathing thought eg thought of suicide bear a negative tone or depict confessional experience based on prior research and our own work on mental health discourse on reddit we find that these are the topical dimension along which high selfdisclosure and lowno selfdisclosure post vary in essence high selfdisclosure post share extensively their personal belief and fear for instance their vital construct and private sensitive informational attribute the post excerpt below have been classified to be of high selfdisclosure and through them we demonstrate the use of some of the ngrams in table i dont want to kill myself i havent felt suicidal in a long time but i just want to stop life for a while you know my dad would beat the living shit out of me ive been to the hospital so many time ive lost track i hate this i hate myself i dont want to f be this person anymore im unmotivated unfocused immature
it is possible to extract various feature from the activity history of twitter user this section explains what kind of feature are used to estimate degree of depression and the way in which these quantity are extracted table show the feature used in this study a detailed explanation of each feature follows the frequency of word in a tweet ie it bag of word are used a a basic feature relating to the content of the tweet tsugawa et al showed that the word frequency are useful for identifying depression mecab wa used to for morphological stemming and categorization of the japanese tweet text to obtain accurate word frequency particle auxiliary verb adnominal adjective and visual symbol were excluded for extracting content word word used by only one participant were also excluded resulting in a total of distinct word however most of these word were rarely used and the distribution of word frequency is extremely biased see fig because word with a low rate of use were regarded a unlikely to be associated with depression for most user the frequency of only the word with the highest rate of use corresponding to or more us across all participant were used a a feature in this study furthermore because the number and length of tweet differed by participant the word frequency were normalized by the total number of word in the tweet the topic of the tweet of each user a estimated by using a representative topic model lda were used a a second feature relating to the content of the tweet with lda the distribution of topic in each document is estimated from the word frequency in each text through unsupervised learning on the assumption that the text and the word in it are generated according to a particular topic in lda the number of topic to identify and a set of document a bag of word are used a input and a topic distribution is output for each document a mentioned in related work section the topic of essay written by university student were estimated by using lda and found to be useful in evaluating degree of depression from that study topic are expected to be a useful feature a set of all tweet of each user wa used a the user document for input in lda and the word selected a described above were used a the word we used lda with collapsed gibbs sampling a the parameter of lda we used k and where k is the number of topic all extracted topic were used a the feature the ratio of positive word and the ratio of negative word used in the tweet text are used a the final feature relating to tweet content user with depression are intuitively expected to use negative word more frequently than user without depression do to categorize word a dictionary of affective word which is compiled by manual evaluation of a dictionary of positive and negative word extracted according to a technique proposed in the literature is used the dictionary contains positive word and negative word the user timing of tweet frequency of tweet average number of word retweet rate rate of republishing other user tweet mention rate rate of directly referencing at least one other user ratio of tweet containing a uniform resource locator url number of user being followed and number of user following are used a feature independent of the content of the tweet the relative ratio of tweet posted during each hour of the day were used to characterize the timing of tweet the number of post per day wa used a the posting frequency and the ratio of qualifying tweet to all tweet were used for the retweet ratio mention ratio and ratio of tweet containing a url these feature are used in prior research
in an effort to minimize noisy and unreliable data we applied several quality assurance measure in our data collection process mturk worker who have completed at least task with a minimum approval rating have been found to provide reliable valid survey response we restricted survey visibility only to worker with these qualification survey access wa also restricted to u ip address a mturk data collected from outside the united state are generally of poorer quality all participant were only permitted to take the survey once we excluded participant with a total of fewer than five twitter post we also excluded participant with cesd score of or lower depression or tsq score of or lower ptsd study have indicated that a cesd score of represents an optimal cutoff for identifying clinically relevant depression an equivalent tsq cutoff of ha been found to be optimal in the case of ptsd we note here that in the study that inspired the present work de choudhury et al used two depression scale cesd and bdi and filtered individual whose depression score did not correlate across the both scale this additional criterion is a methodological strength of de choudhury et al with respect to the present work
ngrams of order to to found via happierfuntokenizer and restricted to those used by at least of user resulting in ngrams the feature were encoded a relative frequency of mentioning each ngram ng
to characterize the difference between clinical and control community a variety of feature are extracted affective feature we use the lexiconaffective norm for english word anew to extract the sentiment conveyed in the content this lexicon consists of word rated in term of valence and arousal and is thus suitable for a quantitative estimation the valence of anew word is on a scale of very unpleasant to very pleasant the arousal is measured on the same scale least active to most active a cloud visualization of anew word used in the blog post made by clinical and control group is illustrated in fig mood tag livejournal provides a mechanism for user to tag their post from a list of predefined mood label thus in addition to the emotion expressed in the text of post the mood tag produced allows u direct access to the user sentiment a cloud visualization of mood tagged on blog post made by clinical and control community is llustrated in fig liwc feature we examine the proportion of word in psycholinguistic category a defined in the liwc package linguistic social affective cognitive perceptual biological relativity personal concern and spoken table present the mean of these liwc psycholinguistic process for the clinical and control community whilst similar in the use word with positive emotion people in the clinical community tend to use word with more negative emotionas example anxiety anger and sadness further they discus more issue about health and death in comparison with the control group on the other hand the user in the control group discus more neutral life related topicsingestion home and leisure word topic for extracting topic latent dirichlet allocation lda is used a a bayesian probabilistic modelling framework lda extract the probability that is word in a topic and then assigns a topic to each word in a document for the inference part we implemented gibbs inference detailed in we set the number of topic to run the gibbs for sample and use the last gibbs sample to interpret the result
weibo post were segmented using the stanford word segmenter that resulted in word and phrase thereafter the scliwc dictionary wa applied to count the appearance of each category of word in every respondent weibo post the scliwc dictionary includes word that are grouped into category including main linguistic or psychological category and subcategories in addition the total number of word or phrase that each respondent published in the month wa counted a the nd category score of the scliwc category were counted a percentage of the total number of word
we now present a methodology of identifying post shared in university subreddits that that are likely to be mental health expression note that our reddit data doe not contain any gold standard information around whether a post shared in a university subreddit is about one mental health experience or condition our proposed method overcomes this challenge by employing an inductive transfer learning approach first we include a ground truth data reddit post made on various mental health support community prior work ha established that in these community individual selfdisclose a variety of mental health challenge explicitly parallelly we utilize another set of reddit post made on generic subreddits unrelated to mental health to be a control next we build a machine learning classifier to distinguish between these two type of post then we learn feature that could detect whether an post shared in a university subreddit could be an expression of some mental health concern we discus these step in detail in the following subsection
in this work we are focused on two main type of feature linguistic and behavioral tfidf is adopted to model the linguist feature of patient and pattern of life feature plf adopted from the work of coppersmith et al is used to model the behavioral style of patient tfidf feature to capture the frequent and representative word used by the patient tfidf is applied on the unigram and bigram collected from all the patient tweet pattern of life feature plf these feature reveal the emotional pattern and behavioral tendency of user by measuring polarity emotion and social interaction in order to fully compose the plf we combined the following list of feature age and gender twitter doe not publicly provide information about the age and gender of it user mainly due to privacy concern so we adopted the work of sap et al to fill in this information polarity feature the sentiment api wa used to label each tweet a either positive negative or neutral the polarity is furthermore transformed into five different value to capture the affective trait of each user positive ratio the percentage of positive tweet negative ratio the percentage of negative tweet positive combo capture the mania and hypomania trait of patient which is determined by the number of continuous positive post appearing more than x amount of time within a period of time in minute t negative combo capture the depression trait of patient and is determined by the number of continuous negative post appearing more than x amount of time within a period of time in minute t flip ratio quantifies the emotional unstableness and is determined by counting how frequently two continuous tweet with different polarity either positive to negative or negative to positive appear together within a period of time in minute t in our work x is set to and t is set to minute social feature these feature can demonstrate how user are behaving with respect to their environment the following are the social feature designed for each user tweeting frequency the frequency of daily post mention ratio the percentage of post which contain at least one mention of another user frequent mention the number of twitter user mentioned more than three time which is a measurement of how many close friend a particular user may have unique mention the number of unique user mentioned which is a measure of the width of a user social network
the data preprocessing procedure for the collected post data is presented in fig after collecting the data each title wa combined with it corresponding post we removed unnecessary punctuation mark and white space for each post then we used the natural language toolkit nltk implemented in python to tokenize user post and filter frequently employed word stop word porter stemmer a tool used to define a series of guideline for exploring word meaning and source wa employed on the tokenized word to convert a word to it root meaning and to decrease the number of word corpus after this procedure data from user with post in total were employed for the analysis
we now briefly describe our approach for cohortbased study over social medium a more detailed description of the proposed methodology will appear in a forthcoming publication most work on social medium analysis estimate trend by aggregating documentlevel signal inferred from arbitrary and biased data sample selected to match a predefined outcome while some recent work ha begun incorporating demographic information to contextualize analysis mandel et al mitchell et al huang et al and to improve representativeness of the data coppersmith et al b do real and culotta these study still select on specific outcome we depart from these work by constructing a demographically representative digital cohort of social medium user prior to the analysis and then conducting cohortbased study over this preselected population while a significant undertaking in most medical study the vast quantity of available social medium data make assembling social medium cohort feasible such cohort can be used to support longitudinal and crosssectional study allowing expert to contextualize the outcome produce externally valid trend from inherently biased sample and extrapolate those trend to a broader population similar strategy have been utilized in online survey which can have comparable validity to other survey modality simply by controlling for basic demographic feature such a the location age ethnicity and gender duffy et al
first we removed journal with no text and those with fewer than character leaving million journal for topic modelling next we preprocessed the text using the stanford tweet tokenizer which is a twitteraware tokenizer designed to handle short informal text we used the option that truncates character repeating or more time converting phrase such a im sooooo happyy to im soo happyy on average the number of token per journal wa since we are interested in topic we removed stopwords and token with fewer than two letter and we only retained noun which appear in the wordnet corpus after this filtering the average number of noun per journal wa example of frequently appearing noun in alphabetical order include anxiety class dinner family god job lunch miss school sick sleep and work we then iteratively clustered the journal into topic detail below and removed noun that do not refer to topic such a number timing eg today yesterday general feeling eg feel like proper noun and noun that have ambiguous meaning eg overall true lastly we only retained noun that appeared more than ten time in the dataset this process resulted in a vocabulary of word for topic modelling each journal is represented a a dimensional term frequency vector with each component denoting the termfrequency inversedocumentfrequency tfidf of the corresponding term algorithm summarizes our topic modelling methodology given a tfidf term frequency vector for each journal we run nonnegative matrix factorization nmf implemented in python scikitlearn package the objective of nmf is to find two matrix whose product approximates the original matrix in our case one matrix is the weighted set of topic in each journal and the other is the weighted set of word that belong to each topic hence each journal is represented a a combination of topic which are themselves composed of a weighted combination of word we chose nmf because it nonnegativity constraint aid with interpretability in the context of analyzing word frequency negative presence of a word would not be interpretable this is because we only track word occurrence and not semantics or syntax unlike other matrix factorization method nmf reconstructs each document from a sum of positive part which enables u to easily manually label the discovered topic iterating from to topic we derived different topic matrix step and of algorithm each matrix consists of one topic per row each topic ha a positive weight for each word in the vocabulary stronger weight indicate higher relevance to the topic the final topic matrix we used ha topic and is shown in table we show the first six word in this table for simplicity where we sorted the word associated with each topic from highest relevance to lowest when judging the topic matrix we considered the top twenty most important word per topic using this information we manually labeled each row in the matrix with a corresponding topic furthermore we manually evaluated each matrix based on the distinctness between topic consistency within topic and interpretability during this process we compiled a custom list of removed word that we mentioned earlier in this section the group of word we removed appeared a standalone topic that did not offer information about what the journal wa about for example proper noun appeared a a standalone topic other word which we deemed too general or ambiguous appeared across several topic and hence did not provide discriminative information we tested different level of regularization to enforce sparseness in our model see for a discussion but did not find significant difference however one important modification we made to regularize each topic wa to make their first word only a strong a their second one by default first word are stronger than second word which are stronger than third word and so on this is since the most relevant word for each topic tended to be too strong of a signal regardless of how we changed the number of topic preprocessing procedure or regularization in the objective function for example the word love in a journal about sport would be so strong that the journal would be labeled a relating to romantic love lowering the importance of first word wa sufficient to eliminate the false positive we identified given the final topic matrix summarized in table the next step is to use it to assign label to journal step and of algorithm we plotted the distribution of how important each topic wa to all journal in the dataset with importance ranging from zero to one each distribution had a similar shape with a clear inflection point between to importance figure show an example importance distribution for the topic work where the inflection point occurs at importance
we focus on the social medium platform twitter a popular microblogging service used by of u internet user and whose popularity continues to increase twitter is particularly interesting to study since nearly all post are public the public nature of tweet provides an interesting counterpoint to the private nature of search engine activity we gathered a month sample of twitter firehose stream which includes all public tweet between november and march made available to u under contract focusing on englishlanguage tweet twitter post count and unique user count were computed for each condition and aggregated over the full time period specifically we considered a post to belong to a certain health condition if there wa a regular expression match of the condition to the text of the post this would not permit substring match within term to reduce noise we excluded post that were retweets or contained hyperlink since they were likely related to general news and not a user personal health using this method we obtained tweet on the health condition from user in the time period of interest the median number of post wa per condition from a median of user per condition
to understand the nature of selfdisclosure in reddit post we first examine the general linguistic attribute manifested in their content in table we first present a list of the most popular stopword eliminated unigrams that appear in reddit posting we intended to look at these highly shared unigrams more deeply and systematically hence we organized these unigrams stopword inclusive in various semantic category provided by the psycholinguistic lexicon liwc httpwwwliwcnet we find that among the unigrams in table there are word that extensively span emotional or affective expression happy love bad anxiety good hate eg ive been recently wondering if my love to numb the world around me ha turned me into an alcoholic ha anyone else battled numbness loss of feeling during recovery doe it ever get better ive been sober for about year and still have pretty severe anxiety at time we observe presence of relationship and social life word too family friend people person parent eg i get really anxious out when i go home for big event i do love my family theyre just really loud and argumentative sometimes temporal indicator in reddit discourse is also visible eg time day year month hi all im ten week sober today and while i wish i could say im physically and mentally in great shape the truth is i judge my day by how i feel le bad a oppose to good work and daily grind oriented word are common a well because lifestyle irregularity are often associated with the psychopathology of mental illness prigerson et al eg life school work job i am completely broke cant afford rehab and cant take time off work we also find a fair number of cognitive word in these highly used unigrams felt hard feeling lot eg im new here but having anxiety like i havent felt in a long time i find a lot of strength in going to a concert i have been understanding of my anxiety and depression since i wa about and i hated it these observation are supported by psychology literature where cognitive bias a manifested through dysfunctional attitude depressive attributional bias and negative automatic thought were found to be characteristic of mental illness eaves rush further inhibition word like avoid deny safe demonstrate that redditors are perhaps using the platform to broadcast their thought to an audience of stranger or weak tie on issue and topic they might consider to be socially stigmatic to be discussed elsewhere i cant escape the feeling of fright i have at all time i dont feel safe in my own home ive been denying my assumed depression symptom for close to two year now writing them off comparing across different liwc semantic category over all post we observe noticeable difference kruskalwallis oneway analysis of variance indicated the difference across category to be significant n p table report the top most common liwc category the mean proportion of word from each category in the post and the corresponding standard deviation note that the percentage over all category sum to greater than since a word could belong to multiple category observing closely many of the category whose corresponding unigrams appeared in table are also highly prominent category globally over all post a given in table not shown in table perhaps intuitively negative emotion anger and sadness word were considerably more prominent than positive emotion word a wilcoxon signed rank test reveals that the difference are statistically significant z p likely these redditors experience several negative emotion hence mental instability helplessness loneliness restlessness manifest in their posting rude et al the health and social issue they are facing in fact high selfattentional focus is a known psychological attribute of mental illness sufferer chung pennebaker
finally to complement the visual theme our research goal rq we identify theme from the caption and hashtags textual data associated with the instagram image in our dataset we refer to these latent topic a linguistic theme existing literature emphasizes the importance of studying language since it reflects a variety of thought function a a signal of identity and emphasizes the social distance we believe the linguistic theme may therefore help u contrast the visual theme around how individual engage in mental health disclosure on instagram we used twitterlda to extract these linguistic theme this method wa developed for topic modeling of short text corpus for mining the latent topic a typically done in topic modeling we preprocessed the data by removing a standard list of stop word word with very high frequency and word that occur fewer than five time since lda is an unsupervised learning approach identifying the correct number of topic is challenging we used the default hyperparameter setting and topic which we determined based on the value of average corpus likelihood over ten run these topic constituted what is known a lifted form of linguistic vocabulary on these extracted linguistic vocabulary to arrive at interpretive description we call them linguistic theme we adopted a similar semiopen coding approach a the visual theme that involved the same two researcher a above the raters referred to the mental health literature and identified the best possible description that characterized the token in the linguistic vocabulary corresponding to each of the linguistic topic to characterize and represent each of the visual and the linguistic theme we propose a measure of visual diversity this measure estimate how coherent image are with respect to the each other in a theme to measure the diversity in term of the latent visual feature image are expressed in term of their principle component within a theme in the component space distance between a pair of image are computed by employing the cosine theta similarity function to perform these set of operation we utilize the python scikitlearn library
tweet about depression were collected by simply measured a company that specializes in social medium measurement and analytics simply measured simply measured ha access to the twitter firehose or full volume of tweet via gnip a licensed company that can retrieve the full twitter data stream all tweet in the english language that contained at least either depressed depressed depression or depression were collected between april and may we scanned a random sample of the tweet to identify common phrase that included our keywords of interest but were not about mental health in sa version sa institute inc cary nc we used the index function which search a character expression in this case the text of the tweet for a specific string of character to locate and remove such tweet from our sample we removed tweet that included the following term regardless of capitalization great depression economic depression during the depression depression era tropical depression and depressed real estate the popularity and influence of the tweeter wa described using the distribution of follower and klout score while number of follower is a measure of popularity klout score is a measure of influence klout score range from to with a higher score indicating higher influence klout score is calculated based on an algorithm that considers over signal from eight different online network example of signal include the amount of retweets a person generates in relation to the amount of tweet shared and the amount of engagement a user drive from unique individual eg lot of retweets from different individual a opposed to lot of retweets from one person klout inc
we follow the data acquisition and curation process of coppersmith et al a summarizing the major point here social medium such a twitter contains frequent public statement by user reporting diagnosis for various medical condition many talk about physical health condition eg cancer flu but some also discus mental illness including schizophrenia there are a variety of motivation for user to share this information on social medium to offer or seek support to fight the stigma of mental illness or perhaps to offer an explanation for certain behavior we obtain message with these selfreported diagnosis using the twitter api and filtered via caseinsensitive regular expression to require schizo or a close phonetic approximation to be present our expression matched schizophrenia it subtypes and various approximation schizo skitzo skitso schizotypal schizoid etc all data we collect are public post made between and and exclude any message marked a private by the author all use of the data reported in this paper ha been approved by the appropriate institutional review board irb each selfstated diagnosis included in this study wa examined by a human annotator one of the author to verify that it appeared to be a genuine statement of a schizophrenia diagnosis excluding joke quote or disingenuous statement we obtained user with an apparently genuine selfstated diagnosis of a schizophreniarelated condition note that we cannot be certain that the twitter user wa actually diagnosed with schizophrenia only that their statement of being diagnosed appears to be genuine previous work indicates that interannotator agreement for this task is good coppersmith et al a for each user we obtained a set of their public twitter post via the twitter api collecting up to tweet a we wish to focus on userauthored content we exclude from analysis all retweets and any tweet that contain a url which often contain text that the user did not author we lowercase all word and convert any nonstandard character including emoji to a systematic ascii representation via unidecode for our community control we used randomlyselected twitter user who primarily tweet in english specifically during a two week period in early each twitter user who wa included in twitter spritzer sample had an equal chance for inclusion in our pool of community control we then collected some of their historic tweet and assessed the language they tweeted in according to the chromium compact language detector user were excluded from our community control if their tweet were le than english
we also present an analysis of the usage of various ngrams in post shared succeeding and preceding celebrity suicide specifically we focus on uni bi and trigram we refer to them a ngrams throughout the paper for comparison of the post and precelebrity suicide period we compute log likelihood ratio of each ngram given a the logarithm of the ratio of the probability of occurrence of the ngram in the postsuicide period to the probability of the same ngram over the presuicide period thus when a ngram is equally frequent it log likelihood ratio will be zero it would be greater than if it is more frequent post celebrity suicide whereas le than if the reverse
this study aimed to examine the prevalence of affective micropatterns in social medium post and highlight difference in micropattern occurrence that might be relevant to quantifying mental health primarily we do this through comparison of user with anxiety disorder eating disorder schizophrenia suicide attempt history and their matched control we use a straightforward and wellunderstood method for sentiment analysis vader hutto and gilbert to produce a trinary label for each message positive neutral or negative vader output a score for each sentiment label we use the label with the maximum score specifically we examined trajectory of posted emotional content in three subsequent tweet no more than three hour from earliest to latest the same tweet will be counted in more than one over lapping micropattern if more than three tweet occur in the threehour time window so if tweet occur in hour micropatterns will be recorded from those tweet likewise for tweet micropatterns will be recorded the potential overlap exists for both patient and neurotypical user and subsequent analysis eg classifying user based on proportion of micropatterns were designed to be robust to this property of overlapping micropattern generation the number of sequential tweet to examine wa chosen to minimize the complexity of the analysis while allowing significant variability to be observed critically we aimed for the resulting dimension ie number of distinct micropatterns to be small enough for meaningful interpretation by clinical psychologist
for inferring the country name corresponding to a user we adopted a stepwise approach a follows first we cleaned the location string reported in the location field of twitter user profile including normalization of character case and removal of nonenglish word root then we performed a location matching exercise wherein we split the cleaned location string into single word iteratively created all possible togram substring and then matched each ngram to a location database based on geonames httpwwwgeonamesorg preferring larger ngrams over smaller one new york city to york third we performed disambiguation by computing geographic distance between matched textadjacent place and assigned high likelihood to those match that are close to each other geographically we then sorted equally likely location alternative by population size and choose the top one we note that compared to geolocated twitter post this location field string lookup method ha been known to yield better coverage in social medium data
the selection of the tweet and their user wa based on the filtered realtime streaming support provided by the twitter api in the first step we selected the user who showed potential sign of depression on twitter on the basis of the most frequent word in spanish expressed by patient suffering from depression in clinical setting these word were jointly identified and selected by a psychologist and a family physician with clinical experience and were based on the definition and general feature of depression according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder the list of word used and their english translation are shown in textbox during june tweet including or more occurrence of the word listed in textbox were collected from this collection of tweet and to select the user who publicly stated in the textual description associated to their profile that they suffered from depression all the profile description including or more occurrence of the word depr and all the possible derivation related to the word depression in spanish such a depre depresin depresivo depresiva deprimido and deprimida were considered from the user who included or more of these word in their description profile user who stated they suffered from depression or were receiving treatment for depression were selected for the analysis this selection wa performed by a psychologist verifying that the statement were related to real expression of depression excluding quote joke or fake one for each of these depressed twitter user we collected all the most recent tweet from their timeline up to a maximum of about tweet thus a total of tweet were collected a figure that wa reduced to after discarding the retweets these tweet constituted the depressive user dataset example of sentence appearing in the user profile that were used for selecting the depressive user are paciente psiquitrico con depresin crnica psychiatric patient with chronic depression example of a profile sentence that indicates depression colecciono errores traducidos a tweet depresivos y a uno que otro impulso de amor i gather error translated into depressing tweet and into one or another love impulse example of a profile sentence that doe not indicate depression once the user with profile sentence indicating depression had been retrieved their twitter timeline were collected only those user having in their timeline at least tweet that suggested sign of depression were retained for further analysis for each user the selection of these tweet wa performed by manually inspecting the tweet of the user complete timeline in reverse temporal order starting from the most recent one to the oldest tweet of the timeline retrieved by mean of the twitter api finally a total number of tweet issued by the depressive user suggesting sign of depression were detected and used for the analysis this set of tweet provided u with the depressive tweet dataset which wa used to analyze linguistic feature of tweet showing sign of depression it ha to be mentioned that these tweet were not to be included in the depressive user dataset see figure at the same time more than tweet were also collected in june such tweet were gathered by listening to the public twitter stream during this time span by only considering tweet with spanish textual content a detected by twitter language identification support given that twitter requires more restrictive filter than just the language of the tweet we used a list of the most frequently used spanish word stopwords to retrieve all tweet that included or more of these word the vast majority of spanish tweet should match this criterion a sample of user who did not mention in their profile the word depression and it derivation were selected randomly from the tweet the complete timeline of these user were compiled tweet which were reduced to once retweets were removed these tweet constituted the control dataset to identify the language of a tweet we relied on the language automatically identified by twitter for each tweet selecting tweet in spanish it ha to be noted that these data can contain some tweet from unidentified depressive user
data wa collected from cup of tea an anonymous online chatbased peer support community for emotional distress user agree at signup that their data may be used for the purpose of research all the data used for the current study wa anonymous and securely stored this research wa performed in line with the ethical and privacy protocol outlined in detail in benton et al data from cup take the form of written dialogue between user of the service and volunteer who are trained a active listener a fragment of an exchange between the user of the service u and the volunteer v might go a follows for the analysis reported in this paper we used only text generated by user of the service not the volunteer providing peer support user who reported depression a their primary concern at sign up were eligible for inclusion in analysis our original sample wa comprised of conversation involving unique user user were excluded from the sample if they did not indicate their culture or if they selected other this resulted in the exclusion of and user respectively the original sample also included user identifying a native american or american indian this group wa excluded from analysis since the majority of the data among these user wa not english this resulted in the removal of user leaving a total sample size of
general linguistic difference to better understand the contentbased difference between post from individual in the minority sample we compare the top unigrams bigram and trigram from each minority country to those from the majority sample we filter out any word that were only one character a well a the natural language toolkits built in stopwords the top ngrams unigrams bigram and trigram can be seen in table ngrams that have been redacted are the usernames of talklife user that were discussed in plain text by others on the website we can make a few observation from the relative frequency of ngrams first english is the most commonly used language within each community on talklife a word from language native to each country were not the majority of any of the ngrams second top ngrams from the majority sample are not common to the top ngrams in any of the minority sample suggesting a difference in how people express mental health even when people are talking about the same theme such a getting support they tend to use different phrase the majority sample us need someone to talk to while indian prefer like to talk to friend third while much of the language most often expressed by user in the majority sample is support language expressing individual distress such a im or feel we find that people from the minority sample are more likely to talk about themselves in relation to other people a illustrated by the bolded ngrams in table for example individual from the minority sample use the term u at a higher amount than those in the majority sample further individual from india often talk about wanting or needing friend whereas individual from malaysia and filipino refer to loneliness using the word alone more often than people in the majority sample this use of term related to interpersonal connection to express mental distress is seen in india malaysia and the philippine when individual experiencing distress are asked to describe how they are feeling our finding extends this work in the context of online mental health support community finally reference to religion such a god or pray find peace are more common in post from malaysia and the philippine this follows past research on the expression of mental health in both malaysia and the philippine showing that religion is often used a a foundation for how people from these cultural background express mental health concern and for how people support one another the higher presence of reference to religion among user from malaysia and the philippine might also suggest that index post that discus religion but do not specifically discus distress might actually be one culturallysanctioned method of signposting a state of mental distress a seen in past research in offline context difference in clinical language use based on past research showing that individual from minority country often express mental distress in nonclinical term we examine the use of clinical language on online mental health support community for this analysis of clinical language around mental distress from different country we use data from the top of user based on number of post on talklife to analyze a greater number of post a table show the amount of clinical language consistently differs between the majority sample and minority sample we find that clinical language is used le frequently in post from the minority sample than in the majority sample for indian malaysian and filipino of index post have clinical language respectively compared to for the majority sample we see a similar but smaller difference for support response of support response tend to have clinical language for the minority sample compared to for the majority samplethese difference are significant with a p unless otherwise indicated for all country though we find consistently that support response have le amount of clinical language than index post however if we look at the frequency of clinical language within post the difference between the minority sample and the majority sample is small combined with the evidence that the fraction of post with at least one use of clinical language is substantially lower for the minority sample this implies that there must be higher use of clinical language term per post for each post from the minority sample that doe contain clinical language this implication is verified by the last two row of table when we restrict our analysis to only those post that do contain clinical language post from the minority sample use more clinical mental health language in comparison to the majority sample for both index post and support response with a statistically significant difference at p thus while a smaller fraction of post in the minority sample use clinical language overall there is a big variation in it use post that do use clinical language tend to use many more term per post than those from majority country suggesting that people who do use clinical language from minority country are participating in a standard and globalized language around describing clinical mental health table confirms the above result when we look at the top unigrams bigram and trigram of clinical language used by people from different country the percentage for each term or ngram correspond to the fraction of occurrence of the ngram relative to all clinical ngrams we find that there is not much variation between the clinical language term that are used across the different country the disorder that are talked about most explicitly such a borderline personality disorder personality disorder or social anxiety are used at relatively consistent rate between both the minority sample and the majority sample a posited above it is possible that this consistency in type of clinical language hint at some form of standardization in how those user who use clinical language use it a globalized online clinical language around mental health and a potential difference between past work on expression of distress in offline setting that said it should be noted that some of the most popular ngrams especially unigrams such a sleep and night can function a false positive a not every mention of sleep or night on talklife is a reference to a mental health issue such a sleep paralysis or night terror these term may also be used in different and culturally bound way more specific term bigram such a anxiety disorder and trigram such a borderline personality disorder are used rarely finally we also report potential crosscultural difference when individual first begin to use clinical language on talklife on average indian tend to use clinical language on the th post mean whereas malaysian filipino and the population from the majority sample tend to use clinical language on the th post mean interpretation of these result will require more work investigation the reason why indian use clinical language later in a thread on balance these result show that individual from the minority sample use lesser amount of clinical language overall but also show more variation in use than people from the majority sample and add nuanced perspective to past work showing that individual from these minority country are often le likely to use clinical language when conceptualizing and describing their experience of mental distress
