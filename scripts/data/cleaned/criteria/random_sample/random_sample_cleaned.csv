https://aclanthology.org/W19-3013.pdf,1,our cohort construction process entail two key step first randomly selecting a large sample of twitter user and second annotating those user with key demographic attribute while such attribute are not provided by the api automated method can be used to infer such trait from data cesare et al following this approach we develop a demographic inference pipeline to automatically infer age gender raceethnicity and location for each cohort candidate age identifying age based on the content of a user can be challenging and exact age often cannot be determined based on language use alone therefore we use discrete category that provide a more accurate estimate of age teenager below s s s s year or older gender the gender wa inferred using demographer a supervised model that predicts the binary gender of twitter user with feature based on the name field on the user profile knowles et al raceethnicity the standard formulation of race and ethnicity is not well understood by the general public so categorizing social medium user along these two ax may not be reasonable therefore we use a single measure of multicultural expression that includes five category white w asian a black b hispanic h and other location the location wa inferred using carmen an opensource library for geolocating tweet that us a series of rule to lookup location string in a location knowledgebase dredze et al we use the inferred location to select user that live in the united state the age and raceethnicity attribute were inferred with custom supervised classifier based on amir et al s userlevel model the classifier were trained and evaluated on a dataset of k annotated user attaining performance of and average f respectively see the supplemental note for additional detail on these experiment we build on prior work on supervised model for mental health inference over social medium data we focus on two mental health condition depression and ptsd and develop classifier with the selfreported datasets created for clpysch mitchell et al coppersmith et al b these labeled datasets derive from user that have publicly disclosed on twitter a diagnosis of depression user or ptsd user with an equal number of randomly selected demographicallymatched with respect to age and gender user a control for each user the associated metadata and posting history wa also collected up to the most recent tweet per limitation of the twitter api the participant of the task proposed a host of method ranging from rulebased system to various supervised model pedersen preotiucpietro et al coppersmith et al b more recently the neural userlevel classifier proposed by amir et al showed not only good performance on this task but also the ability to capture implicit similarity between user affected by the same disease thus opening the door to more interpretable analysis hence we adopt their model for this analysiswe constructed a cohort for our analysis by randomly selecting a sample of twitter user and processing it with the aforementioned demographic inference pipeline after discarding account from user located outside the united state we obtained a cohort of k twitter user with the demographic composition shown in figure some demographic group are overrepresented eg young adult while others are grossly underrepresented eg teenager which illustrates the need for methodology that can take these disparity into account we then processed the cohort through the mentalhealth classifier to estimate the prevalence of depression and ptsd and examine how these illness manifest across the population the analysis revealed that of the cohort member are likely to suffer from depression from ptsd and from both we observe a significant overlap between people affected by depression and ptsd which is not surprising given that the comorbidity of these disorder is wellknown with approximately half of people with ptsd also having a diagnosis of major depressive disorder flory and yehuda how do these condition affect different part of the population to answer this question we looked at the affected user and measured how the demographic of individual subpopulation differ from those of the cohort a a whole figure and show the estimate for depression ptsd and both controlled for the cohort demographic we observe large generational difference ptsd seems to be more prevalent among older people whereas depression affect predominantly younger people we also observe that in all case woman are more susceptible than men and black and hispanic are more likely to be affected than white this may represent a bias in the underlying data used to construct the classifier or a difference in how social medium is used by different demographic group for example model that were trained with a majority of data from white user maybe oversensitive to specific dialect used by other community

question related to that specific incident respondent also described their search objective these response were classified using an iterative open coding process a second rater used this scheme to rate a random sample of response interrater reliability cohens indicated substantial agreement the same verification strategy is used in the rest of this section we coded the intent for respondent the others had unclear intent some search had multiple intent and received multiple categorization so the percentage sum to more than the most common motivation for using a search engine wa to identify treatment option eg stretch to cure or ease tight hamstring alternative and holistic treatment wa a popular subcategory comprising of treatment search eg alternative treatment hypothyroidism the next most common motivation wa diagnosis of a health condition eg whether or not the symptom matched my behavior depression or interpreting the symptom that they experienced eg what may be a cause of this and if it may mean something more may be wrong very heavy menstrual cycle a third motivation wa general understanding of a health condition or procedure including understanding what a medical procedure might entail eg more about the surgery process healing time umbilical hernia understanding the cause of an illness eg the caused sic of it infertility or other general learning about a condition eg prognosis congestive heart failure of recalled search were motivated by understanding medication such a understanding side effect eg to be able to learn the side effect cholesterol medication comparing and contrasting medication eg effectiveness of cancer treatment or seeking information on available medication such a whether nonprescription option are available or learning more about how a medication worked sought lifestyle information for chronic concern particularly nutrition information for managing diabetes cholesterol or weight loss special diet cholesterol beyond these broad category participant also described other intent behind their search activity sought recent medical research finding on condition or their treatment and sought social support such a online support group for people with their diagnosis intent of twitter use for health information seeking in a similar way to engine use the respondent who indicated they had sought health information on twitter were asked to recall the most recent event they explained their objective in freetext open coding wa used to categorize response the same category were used for why people used search engine with additional category added a needed once again substantial agreement wa observed with the second coder rating three response were unclassifiable percentage are of the remaining a with search engine the most common objective wa locating treatment information eg how to help relieve the pain numbness in the leg specifically sought natural or alternative treatment eg natural remedy to headache of respondent sought information about healthy lifestyle such a nutrition dieting or fitness eg different way to lose weight and sought to gain a general understanding of a health condition eg cause eg why it happens enlarged prostate consequence or general knowledge sought new research about condition or treatment and looked to find others with a similar situation to offer support or advice eg if anyone else hsd sic allergy problem only reported seeking diagnostic information on twitter intent of sharing health information on twitter the respondent who recalled sharing information related to their health on twitter were asked to consider the most recent incident and to answer a series of question with that specific occurrence in mind participant explained in freetext what their intent wa behind sharing health information on twitter substantial agreement with second coder were not coded due to vagueness or missing response of the remaining response reported that they intended to share information about their immediate health status or symptom eg i wa having a few teeth removed and i may not be online for a few day wanted to share information or news about a condition eg treatment that work for me fibromyalgia and neuropathywe focus on the social medium platform twitter a popular microblogging service used by of u internet user and whose popularity continues to increase twitter is particularly interesting to study since nearly all post are public the public nature of tweet provides an interesting counterpoint to the private nature of search engine activity we gathered a month sample of twitter firehose stream which includes all public tweet between november and march made available to u under contract focusing on englishlanguage tweet twitter post count and unique user count were computed for each condition and aggregated over the full time period specifically we considered a post to belong to a certain health condition if there wa a regular expression match of the condition to the text of the post this would not permit substring match within term to reduce noise we excluded post that were retweets or contained hyperlink since they were likely related to general news and not a user personal health using this method we obtained tweet on the health condition from user in the time period of interest the median number of post wa per condition from a median of user per condition

https://www.jmir.org/2019/6/e14199/,1,the selection of the tweet and their user wa based on the filtered realtime streaming support provided by the twitter api in the first step we selected the user who showed potential sign of depression on twitter on the basis of the most frequent word in spanish expressed by patient suffering from depression in clinical setting these word were jointly identified and selected by a psychologist and a family physician with clinical experience and were based on the definition and general feature of depression according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder the list of word used and their english translation are shown in textbox during june tweet including or more occurrence of the word listed in textbox were collected from this collection of tweet and to select the user who publicly stated in the textual description associated to their profile that they suffered from depression all the profile description including or more occurrence of the word depr and all the possible derivation related to the word depression in spanish such a depre depresin depresivo depresiva deprimido and deprimida were considered from the user who included or more of these word in their description profile user who stated they suffered from depression or were receiving treatment for depression were selected for the analysis this selection wa performed by a psychologist verifying that the statement were related to real expression of depression excluding quote joke or fake one for each of these depressed twitter user we collected all the most recent tweet from their timeline up to a maximum of about tweet thus a total of tweet were collected a figure that wa reduced to after discarding the retweets these tweet constituted the depressive user dataset example of sentence appearing in the user profile that were used for selecting the depressive user are paciente psiquitrico con depresin crnica psychiatric patient with chronic depression example of a profile sentence that indicates depression colecciono errores traducidos a tweet depresivos y a uno que otro impulso de amor i gather error translated into depressing tweet and into one or another love impulse example of a profile sentence that doe not indicate depression once the user with profile sentence indicating depression had been retrieved their twitter timeline were collected only those user having in their timeline at least tweet that suggested sign of depression were retained for further analysis for each user the selection of these tweet wa performed by manually inspecting the tweet of the user complete timeline in reverse temporal order starting from the most recent one to the oldest tweet of the timeline retrieved by mean of the twitter api finally a total number of tweet issued by the depressive user suggesting sign of depression were detected and used for the analysis this set of tweet provided u with the depressive tweet dataset which wa used to analyze linguistic feature of tweet showing sign of depression it ha to be mentioned that these tweet were not to be included in the depressive user dataset see figure at the same time more than tweet were also collected in june such tweet were gathered by listening to the public twitter stream during this time span by only considering tweet with spanish textual content a detected by twitter language identification support given that twitter requires more restrictive filter than just the language of the tweet we used a list of the most frequently used spanish word stopwords to retrieve all tweet that included or more of these word the vast majority of spanish tweet should match this criterion a sample of user who did not mention in their profile the word depression and it derivation were selected randomly from the tweet the complete timeline of these user were compiled tweet which were reduced to once retweets were removed these tweet constituted the control dataset to identify the language of a tweet we relied on the language automatically identified by twitter for each tweet selecting tweet in spanish it ha to be noted that these data can contain some tweet from unidentified depressive usersthis study wa developed in step in the first step the selection of user and the compilation of tweet were performed a total of datasets of tweet were created a depressive user dataset made up of the timeline of user who explicitly mentioned that they suffer from depression a depressive tweet dataset a manual selection of tweet from the previous user which included expression indicative of depression and a control dataset made up of the timeline of randomly selected user in the second step the comparison and analysis of the datasets of tweet were carried outthis study wa designed and developed in step with the aim of analyzing the linguistic pattern and behavioral feature of twitter user suffering from depression in comparison with the general population of twitter user the study wa focused on tweet written in spanish in the first step the selection of user and the compilation of tweet were performed given the design and purpose of the study we decided to use the twitter application programming interface api using this api datasets of tweet were created the depressive user dataset wa made up of the timeline of user who publicly mentioned on their twitter profile that they suffer from depression the control dataset wa made up of the timeline of randomly selected twitter user the depressive tweet dataset wa constituted by a manual selection of tweet from the depressive user dataset which specifically included expression indicative of depression in the second step comparison and analysis of the datasets of tweet control depressive user and depressive tweet datasets were carried out to spot their distinguishing feature in the rest of this section we will describe the methodology in detail the flow diagram of the study is depicted in

https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359169,1,selection criterion and data scope to understand the impact of cultural difference on how individual use online mental health platform we begin our analysis by creating a dataset of user from different national community on talklife a support platform with over half a million user for this analysis due to the fact that most research in cscw on mental health online ha been done either agnostic of cultural context or in a western context we choose to focus on user from nonwestern country following zhang et al a researcher located in the global south and with lived experience interacting with the health system and diverse explanatory model of mental illness we believe that moving the focus of cscw and cscwadjacent mental health research away from the west is crucial to better meet the need of people often underserved by the medical system to create these subgroup of user we choose the three nonwestern country with the highest user population on talklife or india malaysia and the philippine guided by the rich amount of literature on the unique nuance to mental health expression for each country we examine the national identity linguistic and behaviorbased difference of use between each user subgroup in particular this research note that a a result of cultural norm around the sharing of distress and alternative conceptualization of mental illness in india malaysia and the philippine symptom are often expressed in somatic and religious term a opposed to traditionally clinical or psychiatric term we choose to analyze each subgroup at the national level for both theoretical and practical reason on a theoretical level in past work in the medical anthropology of mental health national identity ha commonly been used for a approximate level of analysis for cultural identity additionally on a more practical level each user country wa determined using their ip address by talklife and shared with u in an useranonymized dataset inferring a more precise location could potentially compromise user anonymity a discussed in past work and did not seem to have any more significant value for our analysis of cultural difference than analysis at the national level we analyze data from indian user malaysian user and filipino user a shown in table collectively we refer to these country a the minority sample a a comparison set we construct a random sample of all thread on talklife and refer to it a the majority sample due to the relative prevalence of user from western englishspeaking country in talklife most of the thread in the majority sample include post from country such a the usa uk and canada indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on talklife data wa sampled from may to june following this crossnational analysis to see if our broader result on talklife generalize to a differently structured online mental health community we picked the largest western country the united state and the largest nonwestern country india represented on cup a similar support platform with more than user actively using the platform each week using cup data we repeat our analysis testing for the same cultural difference we found in our talklife sample for this analysis we were provided a sample of data on activity from indian user and american user a shown in table unlike our sample of talklife user this dataset is not a random sample there is an upsampling of indian user to ensure that we have data from a sufficient number of indian in the dataset like on talklife indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on cup we focus on indian user due to a lack of sufficient data on user from malaysia or the philippine data wa sampled from march august defining cultural identity and use of clinical language in this work we examine the relationship between cultural identity and use of online mental health support forum to do so we leverage tomlinsons definition of cultural identity a self and communal definition based around specific usually politically inflected differentiation gender sexuality class religion race and ethnicity nationality particularly looking at the aspect that of modern cultural identity that run along national line a delineated by hall et al a a diverse and amorphous form of identity cultural identity can often intersect and interact with other form of identity including religious or ethnic identity however in the absence of direct information about religious or ethnic identity based on the data available we use national identity a a proxy for cultural identity additionally following schlesinger et al call for more intersectional analysis and method within hci we also include analysis of adjacent and intersecting identity when relevant including religious identity to analyze clinical language we use a broader definition of clinical language than just specific medical diagnosis following method used in past work to analyze antidepressant related language we create a dataset of clinical mental health language including unigrams bigram and trigram from a list of mental disorder a defined by the international classification of disease icd and diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder dsm we also included all unigrams from the macmillan dictionary list of word used to describe illness and disease both specifically for mental illness and general illness a a result we include unigrams like night from night terror or sleep from sleep disorder a these are often correlated with specific symptom of mental illness or distress such a sleep issue or being awake at night this included any clinically common abbreviation for mental disorder such a ocd for obsessive compulsive disorder or bpd for borderline personality disorder shorthand for disorder commonly used by online community such a proana a used in proeating disorder community were not included due to the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of these term across disorder we choose to use term from and associated with dsm and icd categorized disorder a a result of the common usage of these framework globally throughout our analysis of these varied factor we use to represent mean and to represent standard deviation constraint limitation and tradeoff cultural identity can exist at many different and intersecting level including subculture and subcommunities within the larger umbrella of a cultural identity a a result for the purpose of this analysis we had to adopt some constraint in order to do a meaningful and specific analysis one large limiting constraint that we chose for this study is to use national identity at the state level a a proxy for cultural identity though a major and formative part of modern cultural identity a argued by both hall and tomlinson each country we analyze is incredibly diverse with many individual cultural identity that both intersect and diverge from a greater national identity a more rich analysis of these other form of cultural identity is beyond the scope of this work but could lead to richer conclusion about the nature of cultural identity in online mental health support community particularly with regard to cultural difference between user with the same national identity additionally to stay consistent between analysis a a result of a lack of data on user from malaysia and the philippine we only analyze user in india on cup and extend these finding to the experience of being part of a minority group on an online mental health forum we draw validity for these exploratory finding from similar consistent pattern we observe between indian malaysian and filipino user but a deeper analysis with a larger dataset is likely necessary to determine when and for which minority community these conclusion do not hold true additionally while we construct clinical language through use of the commonly used dsm and icd both framework of illness categorization have significant limitation particularly in the country we have selected for example there are both mental health disorder that are culturebound a well a mental health language that is used in different way within the specific country we analyze such a depression often being an umbrella term for all mental illness additionally it is clear that online support community often develop their own cultural norm and language around mental health and a deeper understanding of how this play out on talklife and cup is neither the focus nor within the scope of this work in this work we intentionally use standard clinical and medical term for mental health disorder in our analysis of clinical language a detailed in past anthropological research it is theorized that the use of medical and clinical language is representative of a medicalized explanatory model of illness and we frame use of this language across culture a a approximate signifier of a greater awareness of the presence of a mental disorder a opposed to conceptualizing distress a stress tension or depression for our analysis we strictly analyzed post that were in the latin alphabet with almost all post on both talklife and cup being in english however a both malay and tagalog are most commonly written in the latin script and since it is common for user from india speaker to use romanized version of indian language online it is possible that a small minority of post in our analysis were text in a different language however a confirmed by only seeing english word used in our analysis of the top ngrams among each user subgroup it is clear that english is the predominant language on both platform though beyond the immediate scope of this work a greater analysis of nonenglish codeswitching on these platform could lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of interaction on expression between user with the same national identity but different language preference
