https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025909,1,we first obtained a list of ranked major university in the united state by crawling the u news and world report website this list is constructed based on the carnegie classification employed extensively by higher education researcher and using a set of indicator of academic excellence defined by u news the list includes a variety of university spread across the u in different setting eg urban rural and with a wide range of student enrollment size figure a show their geographic distribution a a part of this crawl we also obtained university metadata gender distribution of student average tuition and fee and academic calendar semesterquarter to obtain further information about the nature of the student body we crawled the wikipedia page of all of the university from these page we extracted the size of student enrollment type publicprivate and setting ruralsuburbanurbancity at every institution these definition come from a formal categorization scheme used by the u department of education the student body enrollment size ranged from to with public and private university university were reported to be urban city suburban and rural finally we obtained information on racial diversity of the university from a website known a priceonomics the website calculates the herfindahlhirschman index hhi by combining the raceethnicity distribution of student body at different university with data given from the department of education hhi range from the least diverse a population of all one type to n the most diverse where n is the number of different racial category being analyzed social medium data of university next we obtained social medium data of the above university specifically we focused on the social medium reddit why reddit reddit is known to be a widely used online forum and social medium site among the college student demographic due to it forum structure it is extensively used for both content sharing a well a for obtaining feedback and information from community of interest reddit harbor a variety of community known a subreddits including many dedicated to specific university campus this allows a large sample of post shared by student of a university to be collected in one place our preliminary manual inspection of university subreddits eg rgatech or rkstate revealed that these subreddits are appropriated by student to discus college topic table focusing on these public reddit community also doe not require explicit data collection effort to be coordinated at each of the university site although more student are likely to use facebook due to it largely privately shared content it is challenging to obtain access to a large dataset of a university student next while twitter is also widely adopted without explicit selfreported information it is challenging to identify college student account finally prior work note that semianonymity of reddit enables candid self disclosure around stigmatized topic like mental health initial data acquisition we leveraged the archive of all of reddit data made available on google bigquery bigquery is a cloud based managed data warehouse that allows third party to access large publicly available dataset through simple sqltype query our query grabbed all post ranging between june and february available in the reddit data archive this included post from unique user across all of the university with a mean of post and unique user per subreddit filling the gap in subreddit data the second step of our data collection process focused on identifying subreddits with insufficient data and supplementing them through additional alternative data collection through reddits official api httpswwwredditcomdevapi we obtained the most recent number of subscriber in the university subreddits a of july then to investigate if and to what extent some subreddits may have had unusually low data a given in step we determined the median unique user to subscriber ratio in each subreddit this allows u to capture the subreddits where the subscriber count is high however the data obtained is not sufficiently representative for subreddits with unique user to subscriber ratio under median in all we performed a onetime data collection using the reddit api this gave u a set of at most most recent post for each subreddit with a total of post added to the data obtained in step following deduplication we note that this procedure did not skew the yearly distribution of data across the subreddits the skew yearly rate of change before and after data filling were and respectively which were found to be statistically equivalent based on a twosample equivalence test p p a test that us two onesided ttests on the beforeafter yearly rate of change from both side of a chosen difference interval
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7752434,0,to train our model we require information from two different type of user patient and nonpatients therefore we employed a combined manual effort and keyword matching data collection approach to efficiently collect data for these user for the collection of patient we manually collect the community portal relevant to both mental disorder from these portal follower list we select the selfreported user who explicitly state in their profile description that they suffer from a mental illness ie for a given user we are checking if hisher profile contains any keyword related to a target disorder eg borderline bpd bipolar nonpatients are referred to a random active twitter user who are not explicitly stating that they are suffering from bipolar disorder hereinafter referred to a bd or borderline personality disorder hereinafter referred to a bpd to obtain these user we randomly sampled twitter id thereafter we proceeded to download the tweet from the selected id after the user have been identified we manually label them into one of two category patient a person who is suffering from a mental disorder notrelated any user who we dont consider to be a patient lastly after having obtained the final list of patient we retrieve their tweet these step are applied for the collection of both bpd and bd patient datasets
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68764-y,1,detecting mental illness problem in early stage and providing appropriate solution can help potential mental disorder sufferer by collecting and analyzing data from mentalhealthrelated subreddits in reddit that focus on mental disorder issue we introduced a deep learning model with natural language processing method to identify the user with potential mental illness based on their post we believe that our method can open up a new research era where online social medium can play a role a an efficient source for identifying potential mental illness based on user specific post however a majority of people who may have mental illness are still in social blind spot and lack appropriate treatment due to several reason such a difficulty in revealing their status to someone in person or having difficulty in physically accessing the clinic based on the lesson learned the following implication are presented first deep learning approach with appropriate natural language processing method can be used to detect user potential mental illness by their post with the employment of easily accessible social medium data the approach used in this study can be adopted to alert the user who may be suffered from specific mental disorder before they visit counseling center second this study provides notable evidence supporting the possibility of utilizing online platform that can help people in need of mental treatment specifically for example online platform service provider may ask a user consent first to access one account and if agreed can provide the probability of each mental disorder predicted through our validated model based on the user post lastly the current study suggests detecting mental illness in social medium can be a prominent research area in the future the finding of the current study reveal the potential for social medium platform that can play a role in providing a space to interact with others who are suffered by mental disorder however there are a few limitation in this study the current study did not consider several factor eg sociodemographic and regional difference that could affect the classification model these factor can be considered in future research which can improve the quality or accuracy of the deep learning model in addition we collected the data from the public social medium reddit which may be different from the personal feed of social network service in expressing user emotion we did not conduct additional validation procedure of our model with another independent dataset a mentioned above which would need to be further investigated although posting in online social medium could not explicitly tell the symptom compared to post in user personal page that may say they are diagnosed with clinical mental illness online social medium have a potential to be used to identify mental disorder sufferer because they share their symptom relatively accurately under the semianonymity system also we trained our model on a specific mental state to directly classify the symptom and provide the predicted probability for each symptom in this way we could not accurately measure the comorbid mental illness status which is left for future work in future study we could adopt an ensemble approach with our multiple binary classification model which can be utilized to identify the realworld mental condition such a comorbid illness we also plan to validate our proposed model in post of user who may have uncertain mental disease in other social network service such a facebook or twitter in addition a timeseries userlevel analysis that track a user longitudinal behavior pattern can help to develop a userlevel detection model for mental illness using a recurrent neural network based on the lesson learned the following implication are presented first deep learning approach with appropriate natural language processing method can be

https://aclanthology.org/W19-3013.pdf,1,the majority of social medium analysis approach try to extract signal from individual post and thus do not need to record any personal information however a we start moving towards userlevel analysis we are collecting and storing complete record of social medium user communication even though this information is publicly available people might not be consciously aware of the implication of sharing all their data and certainly have not given explicit consent for their data to be analyzed in aggregate this is even more pertinent for analysis involving sensitive information eg health related issue a it ha been demonstrated by the recent incident involving company inadvertently sharing or failing to protect user personal data there is a serious danger of abuse and exploitation for system that collect and store large amount of personal data even though this is in large part an ethical question there are technical solution that can be used to partially address this issue one is to use anonymization technique to obfuscate any detail that allow third party even analyst to identify the individual that are involved in the study another is to store only abstract representation which can still be updated and consumed by predictive model and discard the actual content in regard to consent there are initiative to support voluntary data donation for research purpose eg the our data help program

https://www.jmir.org/2019/6/e14199/,1,this study wa designed and developed in step with the aim of analyzing the linguistic pattern and behavioral feature of twitter user suffering from depression in comparison with the general population of twitter user the study wa focused on tweet written in spanish in the first step the selection of user and the compilation of tweet were performed given the design and purpose of the study we decided to use the twitter application programming interface api using this api datasets of tweet were created the depressive user dataset wa made up of the timeline of user who publicly mentioned on their twitter profile that they suffer from depression the control dataset wa made up of the timeline of randomly selected twitter user the depressive tweet dataset wa constituted by a manual selection of tweet from the depressive user dataset which specifically included expression indicative of depression in the second step comparison and analysis of the datasets of tweet control depressive user and depressive tweet datasets were carried out to spot their distinguishing feature in the rest of this section we will describe the methodology in detail the flow diagram of the study is depicted in figure
