https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702280,1,in this study we gathered information on depression level of twitter user and their activity history to do this we published a website to administer a questionnaire and disseminated information about the website over twitter in contrast to de choudhury et al who collected data from englishspeaking user through crowdsourcing this study collected data from japanesespeaking volunteer this approach wa used to investigate the extent to which depression risk can be estimated for a population different from the population considered by the prior research figure show a screenshot of our website the website collected the response to a questionnaire to evaluate the degree of depression of the twitter user who participated hereinafter the participant and to collect the history of participant activity on twitter the activity history of participant were collected through the twitter application programming interface api and the questionnaire to determine degree of depression were completed by participant through their web browser before data collection visitor to the website were presented with a written explanation of the aim of the experiment the information that would be collected and how that information would be handled those who consented to become participant after receiving the explanation logged into their individual twitter account through the oauth authorization process next participant were surveyed on gender age occupation and history of depression following which they answered a questionnaire designed to evaluate degree of depression a message called the kokoro score kokoro is a japanese word meaning heart determined on the basis of answer to the questionnaire and information in the collected tweet wa displayed to participant after completion of the questionnaire fig experiment participant were able to tweet the message displayed which made it possible to promote the website over twitter by wordofmouth in a type of snowball sampling the cesd questionnaire wa used to evaluate the degree of depression in the cesd test participant answered question on a likerttype point scale each answer wa assigned a score of point with the sum of the point from all answer used a the score to estimate likelihood of depression several standard exist by which to determine the appropriate cutoff score for identifying depression in this research we regarded a score of point or higher a indicating active depression and a score of point or lower a indicating no active depression these are the same value a used in and give a cutoff score of in addition answer to bdi a depression scale used with characteristic similar to cesd were collected to ensure the reliability of data for each participant score were calculated on both scale with poor correlation regarded a indicating unreliable answer the time taken to answer the questionnaire wa also recorded and those completed in too brief a time were excluded after each participant answered the questionnaire the activity history of that participant on twitter wa collected from twitter by using the api at most tweet were collected for each participant and the number of user following the participant and being followed by the participant were recorded tweet published after the questionnaire wa taken were discarded the website wa opened to the public on december at which time the author publicized it on their twitter account between december and february people participated in the experiment after eliminating participant who did not tweet and participant who answered the questionnaire in fewer than second a previously mentioned to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire answer set of answer remained only the first set of answer wa used for participant who completed the questionnaire more than once a a result data about experiment participant male female aged to mean year standard deviation year were analyzed the correlation between cesd score and bdi score for these participant were high and there were no participant with uncorrelated score so the data for all participant were used excluded datasets are not discussed any further figure show the histogram of cesd score of participant among the participant resp were estimated to have resp not have active depression for an incidence of approximately this incidence is similar to that found by de choudhury et al who identified depression in approximately of participant table give statistic on the activity history of participantsfollowing the development of the selfdisclosure classifier we wanted to apply it on an unlabeled set of mental health post in order to study how level of selfdisclosure characterize the nature of discourse and community response on these reddit forum for the purpose we used the unlabeled m mental health forum post obtained by crawling the history of those user in mental health forum who posted five or more time in our observed data on applying our trained selfdisclosure classifier on these m post we find that m post were classified a high selfdisclosure post m post were categorized to be of low selfdisclosure while m were assigned to be having no selfdisclosure this indicates that in general mental health community on reddit are characterized by high selfdisclosure in the shared content presumably individual find these forum to be an open platform that allows expressing view and thought about a topic often considered to be sensitive or unacceptable to the mainstream the ability to be fairly anonymous on reddit perhaps facilitates such high selfdisclosure unlike facebook a user doe not need to specify any personal information in their profile eg location age name gender etc we further observe from figure that majority of the user who selfdisclose more tend to also have longer tenure on reddit by tenure here we mean the total amount of time in month the user ha been observed to be active on reddit based on our dataset most low selfdisclosure user have shorter tenure relatively the same is true for the bulk of the no selfdisclosure user f p based on kruskalwallis test this show that user find the ability to selfdisclose more to be helpful resulting in continued involvement and engagement on the social medium site finally from table we observe that high selfdisclosure post receive fewer upvotes greater downvotes but higher number of comment a well a high response rate here response rate is calculated a the normalized time elapsed between post time and timestamp of first comment on the post this show that high selfdisclosure on mental health subreddits while may not be highly endorsed by the greater reddit community due to their caustic and disinhibiting tone however do receive social support through increased level of engagement commentary and rapidity of response show that the community is keen to help and advise these individual with honest and disinhibiting selfdisclosures the greater conversational length a indicated by the high number of comment also aligns with prior literature where it ha been found that candid discourse result in longer verbal exchange
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12961-9,1,all data collection took place between february and june across both depressed and healthy group we collected data from twitter user totaling tweet this number includes up to tweet from each participant twitter history the analysis in this report focus only on tweet from depressed user created before the date of first depression diagnosis the mean number of post per user wa sd this distribution wa skewed by a smaller number of frequent poster a evidenced by a median value of just post per user see table for summary statistic in the depressed group crowdworkers successfully completed participation and provided access to their twitter data imposing the cesd cutoff reduced the number of viable participant to the mean age for viable participant wa year sd with a range of to year date of participant first depression diagnosis ranged from march to february with nearly all diagnosis date occurring in the period in the healthy group participant completed participation and provided access to their twitter data the mean age for this group wa year with a range of to year and of respondent were female gender data were not collected for affected sample survey for the ptsd analysis we collected data from twitter user totaling the mean number of post per user wa sd this distribution wa skewed by a smaller number of frequent poster a evidenced by a median value of just post per user in the ptsd sample crowdworkers successfully completed participation and provided access to their twitter data imposing the tsq cutoff reduced the number of viable participant to the mean age for viable participant wa year sd with a range of to year date of participant first ptsd diagnosis ranged from april to december with nearly all diagnosis date occurring in the period in the healthy group participant completed participation and provided access to their twitter data the mean age for this group wa year with a range of to year and of respondent were female

https://www.jmir.org/2017/7/e243/,1,a webbased survey of weibo user wa conducted to ass the respondent suicide risk and emotional distress ie depression anxiety and stress the invitation letter to participate in this survey wa widely sent out to general weibo user by various promotion activity for a weibo user to be eligible for the study she or he had to be year or older by selfreport a renminbi incentive for each complete survey wa provided to boost the respond rate with the respondent consent their weibo post that were posted in the public domain during the month before the survey were downloaded by calling weibo api the survey fulfilled the checklist for reporting result of internet esurveys cherry checklist and detail of the procedure have been reported in previous publication in addition when multiple survey feedback were submitted from the same internet protocol address only the first submission wa used to avoid duplicate participation in contrast to a previous study this study excluded those who posted nothing throughout the month but not those who posted fewer than post eventually data provided by respondent remained for further analysis the study ha obtained ethical approval from the human research ethical review committee at the university of hong kong and the institute review board of the institute of psychology at the chinese academy of science the survey measured respondent suicide probability score depression anxiety stress and weibo suicide communication wsc a the outcome variable in addition the respondent weibo post language feature were extracted a independent variable or feature for machine learning the detail of how those data were obtained are elaborated in the following subsection
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025909,1,we first obtained a list of ranked major university in the united state by crawling the u news and world report website this list is constructed based on the carnegie classification employed extensively by higher education researcher and using a set of indicator of academic excellence defined by u news the list includes a variety of university spread across the u in different setting eg urban rural and with a wide range of student enrollment size figure a show their geographic distribution a a part of this crawl we also obtained university metadata gender distribution of student average tuition and fee and academic calendar semesterquarter to obtain further information about the nature of the student body we crawled the wikipedia page of all of the university from these page we extracted the size of student enrollment type publicprivate and setting ruralsuburbanurbancity at every institution these definition come from a formal categorization scheme used by the u department of education the student body enrollment size ranged from to with public and private university university were reported to be urban city suburban and rural finally we obtained information on racial diversity of the university from a website known a priceonomics the website calculates the herfindahlhirschman index hhi by combining the raceethnicity distribution of student body at different university with data given from the department of education hhi range from the least diverse a population of all one type to n the most diverse where n is the number of different racial category being analyzed social medium data of university next we obtained social medium data of the above university specifically we focused on the social medium reddit why reddit reddit is known to be a widely used online forum and social medium site among the college student demographic due to it forum structure it is extensively used for both content sharing a well a for obtaining feedback and information from community of interest reddit harbor a variety of community known a subreddits including many dedicated to specific university campus this allows a large sample of post shared by student of a university to be collected in one place our preliminary manual inspection of university subreddits eg rgatech or rkstate revealed that these subreddits are appropriated by student to discus college topic table focusing on these public reddit community also doe not require explicit data collection effort to be coordinated at each of the university site although more student are likely to use facebook due to it largely privately shared content it is challenging to obtain access to a large dataset of a university student next while twitter is also widely adopted without explicit selfreported information it is challenging to identify college student account finally prior work note that semianonymity of reddit enables candid self disclosure around stigmatized topic like mental health initial data acquisition we leveraged the archive of all of reddit data made available on google bigquery bigquery is a cloud based managed data warehouse that allows third party to access large publicly available dataset through simple sqltype query our query grabbed all post ranging between june and february available in the reddit data archive this included post from unique user across all of the university with a mean of post and unique user per subreddit filling the gap in subreddit data the second step of our data collection process focused on identifying subreddits with insufficient data and supplementing them through additional alternative data collection through reddits official api httpswwwredditcomdevapi we obtained the most recent number of subscriber in the university subreddits a of july then to investigate if and to what extent some subreddits may have had unusually low data a given in step we determined the median unique user to subscriber ratio in each subreddit this allows u to capture the subreddits where the subscriber count is high however the data obtained is not sufficiently representative for subreddits with unique user to subscriber ratio under median in all we performed a onetime data collection using the reddit api this gave u a set of at most most recent post for each subreddit with a total of post added to the data obtained in step following deduplication we note that this procedure did not skew the yearly distribution of data across the subreddits the skew yearly rate of change before and after data filling were and respectively which were found to be statistically equivalent based on a twosample equivalence test p p a test that us two onesided ttests on the beforeafter yearly rate of change from both side of a chosen difference interval we note it is possible that the type of student who frequent the university subreddits could be consistently different from the student body at the same university to examine the representativeness of our university subreddit data we employed a random sample of post distributed across the subreddits and the year for manual examination of demographic two researcher then independently coded these post for selfreported gender race or academic stage undergraduategraduate for instance from the post im a junior transfer and this will be my second semester the researcher identified the post author to be an undergraduate whereas from hi all im a new grad student male here the gender of the author can be inferred to be male we found the interrater agreement to be high cohens the relative ratio between the gender race and academic stage distribution of the coded post and the university student body obtained based on our methodology in the subsection university data showed significant positive correlation the mean undergradgrad ratio in our labeled data wa while it wa in the university a twosample test of equivalence gave pvalues of and respectively with respect to the difference interval the sex malefemale ratio for our labeled data wa also observed to be statistically equivalent to that of the student body p p wrt the difference interval this establishes the validity of our acquired reddit data a a representative data source for studying mental health disclosure in university campus
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7752434,1,in this work we are focused on two main type of feature linguistic and behavioral tfidf is adopted to model the linguist feature of patient and pattern of life feature plf adopted from the work of coppersmith et al is used to model the behavioral style of patient tfidf feature to capture the frequent and representative word used by the patient tfidf is applied on the unigram and bigram collected from all the patient tweet pattern of life feature plf these feature reveal the emotional pattern and behavioral tendency of user by measuring polarity emotion and social interaction in order to fully compose the plf we combined the following list of feature age and gender twitter doe not publicly provide information about the age and gender of it user mainly due to privacy concern so we adopted the work of sap et al to fill in this information polarity feature the sentiment api wa used to label each tweet a either positive negative or neutral the polarity is furthermore transformed into five different value to capture the affective trait of each user positive ratio the percentage of positive tweet negative ratio the percentage of negative tweet positive combo capture the mania and hypomania trait of patient which is determined by the number of continuous positive post appearing more than x amount of time within a period of time in minute t negative combo capture the depression trait of patient and is determined by the number of continuous negative post appearing more than x amount of time within a period of time in minute t flip ratio quantifies the emotional unstableness and is determined by counting how frequently two continuous tweet with different polarity either positive to negative or negative to positive appear together within a period of time in minute t in our work x is set to and t is set to minute social feature these feature can demonstrate how user are behaving with respect to their environment the following are the social feature designed for each user tweeting frequency the frequency of daily post mention ratio the percentage of post which contain at least one mention of another user frequent mention the number of twitter user mentioned more than three time which is a measurement of how many close friend a particular user may have unique mention the number of unique user mentioned which is a measure of the width of a user social network
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68764-y,0,we collected post data from the following six mentalhealthrelated subreddits each of which is reported to be associated with a specific disorder rdepression ranxiety rbipolar rbpd rschizophrenia and rautism in addition we further collected post data from the most popular healthrelated subreddit rmentalhealth to analyze post with general health information from each subreddit we collected all the user id who had at least one post related to the mental health along with user id we also collected title and post using the pushshiftapi note that all the user information is anonymized hence no personally identifiable information wa not included we followed all the anonymization process guided by the sungkyunkwan university institutional review board irb overall the current study collected information from user who wrote post in the seven subreddits from january to december table summarizes the information of collected data
https://aclanthology.org/W19-3013.pdf,1,we now briefly describe our approach for cohortbased study over social medium a more detailed description of the proposed methodology will appear in a forthcoming publication most work on social medium analysis estimate trend by aggregating documentlevel signal inferred from arbitrary and biased data sample selected to match a predefined outcome while some recent work ha begun incorporating demographic information to contextualize analysis mandel et al mitchell et al huang et al and to improve representativeness of the data coppersmith et al b do real and culotta these study still select on specific outcome we depart from these work by constructing a demographically representative digital cohort of social medium user prior to the analysis and then conducting cohortbased study over this preselected population while a significant undertaking in most medical study the vast quantity of available social medium data make assembling social medium cohort feasible such cohort can be used to support longitudinal and crosssectional study allowing expert to contextualize the outcome produce externally valid trend from inherently biased sample and extrapolate those trend to a broader population similar strategy have been utilized in online survey which can have comparable validity to other survey modality simply by controlling for basic demographic feature such a the location age ethnicity and gender duffy et al our cohort construction process entail two key step first randomly selecting a large sample of twitter user and second annotating those user with key demographic attribute while such attribute are not provided by the api automated method can be used to infer such trait from data cesare et al following this approach we develop a demographic inference pipeline to automatically infer age gender raceethnicity and location for each cohort candidate age identifying age based on the content of a user can be challenging and exact age often cannot be determined based on language use alone therefore we use discrete category that provide a more accurate estimate of age teenager below s s s s year or older gender the gender wa inferred using demographer a supervised model that predicts the binary gender of twitter user with feature based on the name field on the user profile knowles et al raceethnicity the standard formulation of race and ethnicity is not well understood by the general public so categorizing social medium user along these two ax may not be reasonable therefore we use a single measure of multicultural expression that includes five category white w asian a black b hispanic h and other location the location wa inferred using carmen an opensource library for geolocating tweet that us a series of rule to lookup location string in a location knowledgebase dredze et al we use the inferred location to select user that live in the united state the age and raceethnicity attribute were inferred with custom supervised classifier based on amir et al s userlevel model the classifier were trained and evaluated on a dataset of k annotated user attaining performance of and average f respectively see the supplemental note for additional detail on these experiment

https://aclanthology.org/W17-3110.pdf,1,we briefly explain the data collection method here but we refer the interested reader with further question on the methodology to coppersmith et al for the suicide attempt data and coppersmith et al a for all other condition the data for these analysis are twitter post collected via two method most of the data come from user who have publicly discussed their mental health condition these user are frequently referred to a selfstated diagnosis user a they state publicly something like i wa diagnosed with schizophrenia or im so thankful to have survived my suicide attempt last year the data for user with a suicide attempt wa supplemented by data from ourdatahelpsorg a data donation site where people provide access to their public post and fill out a short questionnaire about their mental health history data are then deidentified and made available to researcher addressing question of interest to the mental health community donor provide consent for their data to be used in mental health research upon signup of the user who attempted suicide came from ourdatahelpsorg specifically we examine generalized anxiety disorder eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia and attempted suicide these condition were selected based on the theory that there are important timing aspect to their symptom ebbing and flowing of symptom a treatment is effective especially schizophrenia onset and exacerbation of symptom by external event and stress and punctuated event in time of psychological symptom suicide attempt panic attack and bingingpurging behavior with eating disorder we use the twitter streaming api to collect a sample of user who used a series of mental health word or phrase in their tweet text eg schizophrenia or suicide attempt each tweet that us one of these phrase is examined via regular expression to indicate that the user is talking about themselves finally those tweet that pas the regular expression are examined by a human to confirm to the best of our ability that their selfstatement of diagnosis appears to be genuine this result in a dataset with user that have a selfstated diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder n an eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia or someone who would go on to attempt suicide some of these user do not exhibit the sort of posting behavior required to create micropatterns ie they rarely post multiple time within a hour time window we exclude these user from our analysis which is of user for most condition with the exception of those with a suicide attempt where a little over half the user do not exhibit this posting behavior the resultant dataset used for analysis is generalized anxiety disorder n eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia suicide attempt in order to allow comparison of each condition to control user we gather a random sample of twitter user for whom at least of their post are identified by twitter a english all the user with a selfstated diagnosis and all member of this control population have their age and gender estimated according to sap et al for each user with a selfstated diagnosis we find a matched control through the following procedure create a pool of user where the estimated gender match and the estimated age is within the same year bracket the suggested accuracy of the age estimator from that pool of age and gender matched user we select the user whose tweet start and end over the most similar timeframe we will refer to these age gender and timematched control simply a matched control throughout the rest of this paper all tweet were publicly posted by their author ie no user marked at protected or private were included on average user had tweet the distribution of estimated age and gender for user with each selfstated condition can be seen in figure for most condition the population skews female though for schizophrenia the gender are roughly balanced the average age tends to be in the earlytomid s

https://www.jmir.org/2019/6/e14199/,0,the selection of the tweet and their user wa based on the filtered realtime streaming support provided by the twitter api in the first step we selected the user who showed potential sign of depression on twitter on the basis of the most frequent word in spanish expressed by patient suffering from depression in clinical setting these word were jointly identified and selected by a psychologist and a family physician with clinical experience and were based on the definition and general feature of depression according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder the list of word used and their english translation are shown in textbox during june tweet including or more occurrence of the word listed in textbox were collected from this collection of tweet and to select the user who publicly stated in the textual description associated to their profile that they suffered from depression all the profile description including or more occurrence of the word depr and all the possible derivation related to the word depression in spanish such a depre depresin depresivo depresiva deprimido and deprimida were considered from the user who included or more of these word in their description profile user who stated they suffered from depression or were receiving treatment for depression were selected for the analysis this selection wa performed by a psychologist verifying that the statement were related to real expression of depression excluding quote joke or fake one for each of these depressed twitter user we collected all the most recent tweet from their timeline up to a maximum of about tweet thus a total of tweet were collected a figure that wa reduced to after discarding the retweets these tweet constituted the depressive user dataset example of sentence appearing in the user profile that were used for selecting the depressive user are paciente psiquitrico con depresin crnica psychiatric patient with chronic depression example of a profile sentence that indicates depression colecciono errores traducidos a tweet depresivos y a uno que otro impulso de amor i gather error translated into depressing tweet and into one or another love impulse example of a profile sentence that doe not indicate depression once the user with profile sentence indicating depression had been retrieved their twitter timeline were collected only those user having in their timeline at least tweet that suggested sign of depression were retained for further analysis for each user the selection of these tweet wa performed by manually inspecting the tweet of the user complete timeline in reverse temporal order starting from the most recent one to the oldest tweet of the timeline retrieved by mean of the twitter api finally a total number of tweet issued by the depressive user suggesting sign of depression were detected and used for the analysis this set of tweet provided u with the depressive tweet dataset which wa used to analyze linguistic feature of tweet showing sign of depression it ha to be mentioned that these tweet were not to be included in the depressive user dataset see figure at the same time more than tweet were also collected in june such tweet were gathered by listening to the public twitter stream during this time span by only considering tweet with spanish textual content a detected by twitter language identification support given that twitter requires more restrictive filter than just the language of the tweet we used a list of the most frequently used spanish word stopwords to retrieve all tweet that included or more of these word the vast majority of spanish tweet should match this criterion a sample of user who did not mention in their profile the word depression and it derivation were selected randomly from the tweet the complete timeline of these user were compiled tweet which were reduced to once retweets were removed these tweet constituted the control dataset to identify the language of a tweet we relied on the language automatically identified by twitter for each tweet selecting tweet in spanish it ha to be noted that these data can contain some tweet from unidentified depressive user

https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359169,1,selection criterion and data scope to understand the impact of cultural difference on how individual use online mental health platform we begin our analysis by creating a dataset of user from different national community on talklife a support platform with over half a million user for this analysis due to the fact that most research in cscw on mental health online ha been done either agnostic of cultural context or in a western context we choose to focus on user from nonwestern country following zhang et al a researcher located in the global south and with lived experience interacting with the health system and diverse explanatory model of mental illness we believe that moving the focus of cscw and cscwadjacent mental health research away from the west is crucial to better meet the need of people often underserved by the medical system to create these subgroup of user we choose the three nonwestern country with the highest user population on talklife or india malaysia and the philippine guided by the rich amount of literature on the unique nuance to mental health expression for each country we examine the national identity linguistic and behaviorbased difference of use between each user subgroup in particular this research note that a a result of cultural norm around the sharing of distress and alternative conceptualization of mental illness in india malaysia and the philippine symptom are often expressed in somatic and religious term a opposed to traditionally clinical or psychiatric term we choose to analyze each subgroup at the national level for both theoretical and practical reason on a theoretical level in past work in the medical anthropology of mental health national identity ha commonly been used for a approximate level of analysis for cultural identity additionally on a more practical level each user country wa determined using their ip address by talklife and shared with u in an useranonymized dataset inferring a more precise location could potentially compromise user anonymity a discussed in past work and did not seem to have any more significant value for our analysis of cultural difference than analysis at the national level we analyze data from indian user malaysian user and filipino user a shown in table collectively we refer to these country a the minority sample a a comparison set we construct a random sample of all thread on talklife and refer to it a the majority sample due to the relative prevalence of user from western englishspeaking country in talklife most of the thread in the majority sample include post from country such a the usa uk and canada indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on talklife data wa sampled from may to june following this crossnational analysis to see if our broader result on talklife generalize to a differently structured online mental health community we picked the largest western country the united state and the largest nonwestern country india represented on cup a similar support platform with more than user actively using the platform each week using cup data we repeat our analysis testing for the same cultural difference we found in our talklife sample for this analysis we were provided a sample of data on activity from indian user and american user a shown in table unlike our sample of talklife user this dataset is not a random sample there is an upsampling of indian user to ensure that we have data from a sufficient number of indian in the dataset like on talklife indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on cup we focus on indian user due to a lack of sufficient data on user from malaysia or the philippine data wa sampled from march august defining cultural identity and use of clinical language in this work we examine the relationship between cultural identity and use of online mental health support forum to do so we leverage tomlinsons definition of cultural identity a self and communal definition based around specific usually politically inflected differentiation gender sexuality class religion race and ethnicity nationality particularly looking at the aspect that of modern cultural identity that run along national line a delineated by hall et al a a diverse and amorphous form of identity cultural identity can often intersect and interact with other form of identity including religious or ethnic identity however in the absence of direct information about religious or ethnic identity based on the data available we use national identity a a proxy for cultural identity additionally following schlesinger et al call for more intersectional analysis and method within hci we also include analysis of adjacent and intersecting identity when relevant including religious identity to analyze clinical language we use a broader definition of clinical language than just specific medical diagnosis following method used in past work to analyze antidepressant related language we create a dataset of clinical mental health language including unigrams bigram and trigram from a list of mental disorder a defined by the international classification of disease icd and diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder dsm we also included all unigrams from the macmillan dictionary list of word used to describe illness and disease both specifically for mental illness and general illness a a result we include unigrams like night from night terror or sleep from sleep disorder a these are often correlated with specific symptom of mental illness or distress such a sleep issue or being awake at night this included any clinically common abbreviation for mental disorder such a ocd for obsessive compulsive disorder or bpd for borderline personality disorder shorthand for disorder commonly used by online community such a proana a used in proeating disorder community were not included due to the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of these term across disorder we choose to use term from and associated with dsm and icd categorized disorder a a result of the common usage of these framework globally throughout our analysis of these varied factor we use to represent mean and to represent standard deviation constraint limitation and tradeoff cultural identity can exist at many different and intersecting level including subculture and subcommunities within the larger umbrella of a cultural identity a a result for the purpose of this analysis we had to adopt some constraint in order to do a meaningful and specific analysis one large limiting constraint that we chose for this study is to use national identity at the state level a a proxy for cultural identity though a major and formative part of modern cultural identity a argued by both hall and tomlinson each country we analyze is incredibly diverse with many individual cultural identity that both intersect and diverge from a greater national identity a more rich analysis of these other form of cultural identity is beyond the scope of this work but could lead to richer conclusion about the nature of cultural identity in online mental health support community particularly with regard to cultural difference between user with the same national identity additionally to stay consistent between analysis a a result of a lack of data on user from malaysia and the philippine we only analyze user in india on cup and extend these finding to the experience of being part of a minority group on an online mental health forum we draw validity for these exploratory finding from similar consistent pattern we observe between indian malaysian and filipino user but a deeper analysis with a larger dataset is likely necessary to determine when and for which minority community these conclusion do not hold true additionally while we construct clinical language through use of the commonly used dsm and icd both framework of illness categorization have significant limitation particularly in the country we have selected for example there are both mental health disorder that are culturebound a well a mental health language that is used in different way within the specific country we analyze such a depression often being an umbrella term for all mental illness additionally it is clear that online support community often develop their own cultural norm and language around mental health and a deeper understanding of how this play out on talklife and cup is neither the focus nor within the scope of this work in this work we intentionally use standard clinical and medical term for mental health disorder in our analysis of clinical language a detailed in past anthropological research it is theorized that the use of medical and clinical language is representative of a medicalized explanatory model of illness and we frame use of this language across culture a a approximate signifier of a greater awareness of the presence of a mental disorder a opposed to conceptualizing distress a stress tension or depression for our analysis we strictly analyzed post that were in the latin alphabet with almost all post on both talklife and cup being in english however a both malay and tagalog are most commonly written in the latin script and since it is common for user from india speaker to use romanized version of indian language online it is possible that a small minority of post in our analysis were text in a different language however a confirmed by only seeing english word used in our analysis of the top ngrams among each user subgroup it is clear that english is the predominant language on both platform though beyond the immediate scope of this work a greater analysis of nonenglish codeswitching on these platform could lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of interaction on expression between user with the same national identity but different language preference
