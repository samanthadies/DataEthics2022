we obtained post and comment data from a number of mental health subreddits henceforth mhs and a suicide support subreddit rsuicidewatch henceforth sw we focused on a set of mhs that have been examined in prior work on mental health discourse these subreddits included rdepression rmentalhealth rtraumatoolbox rbipolarreddit rbpd rptsd rpsychoticreddit reatingdisorders rstopselfharm rsurvivorsofabuse rrapecounseling rhardshipmates rpanicparty rsocialanxiety while sw solely focus on helping those contemplating suicide the other mhs cover a variety of mental health concern but not specifically suicidal ideation all of these subreddits host public content we used reddits official api to collect post comment and associated metadata from the sw and mhs subreddits httpwwwredditcomdevapi our analysis in this paper is based on all content shared on mhs between february and november post comment and user we refer to the data obtained from sw during the same time period post user to identify those individual in mhs who go on to post on sw over time
we used reddits official api to collect post comment on post and associated metadata from several mental health focused subreddits we build on the data collection methodology we used in in order to arrive at a comprehensive list of subreddits to focus on we utilized reddits native subreddit search feature httpwwwredditcomreddits we searched for subreddits on mental health two researcher familiar with reddit employed an initial filtering step on the search result returned so that we seed on high precision subreddits discussing mental health concern thereafter we focused on a snowball approach to compile a second list of related or similar subreddits that are mentioned in the profile page of the seed subreddits sample of subreddits in all we crawled are given in table note all of these subreddits host public content for the purpose of selfdisclosure detection we also identified subreddits sample listed in table a our control group total of subreddits meaning they are unrelated to mental health topic for sanity check we randomly sampled a set of post from the control subreddits and two researcher familiar with reddit manually checked their content for presence of any mental health content we found that of subreddit content in our sample were not about any mental health concern cohens kappa for interrater agreement wa in all our dataset had post from user in the mental health subreddits and post from user in the control forum for each of the unique user in the mental health forum we further collected all of their reddit postcomment history last postscomments per reddit api limit if their number of post and comment in our dataset wa five or more this gave u user and m postscomments generating ground truth on selfdisclosure automatic detection of selfdisclosure level in post necessitates obtaining gold standard label on selfdisclosure in essence ground truth for the purpose two raters familiar with reddit and it mental health community in particular independently rated a small random sample post with equal proportion from mental health and control subreddits for three level of selfdisclosure no selfdisclosure low and high selfdisclosure these three class of selfdisclosure were chosen based on categorization by bak et al in the raters mutually discussed their label thereafter and thus came up with a set of rule for rating the rule were further aligned with observation in prior work per the rule post that either reveal personal information eg age location gender etc or divulge sensitive or vulnerable thought belief or embarrassingconfessional experience were to be considered to be indicative of high selfdisclosure joinson characterized sensitive disclosure in term of the extent of revealed vulnerability b post about self but not disclosing any personal or emotionally vulnerable content wa to be considered of low selfdisclosure no selfdisclosure post were those which were about people or thing other than the posting author and which divulged information unrelated to the self following these mutually agreed upon rule the previous two raters and an additional rater familiar with reddit independently coded a larger sample of post to create a training set for the purpose of classification the raters had good agreement in their rating fleiss kappa wa found to be however given the subjective nature of characterization of selfdisclosure we considered only those post in the training set for which we had agreement across all three raters this gave u post across the three category the coded set consisted of post of high selfdisclosure post of low selfdisclosure and with no selfdisclosure table give example of mental health post excerpt with high selfdisclosure while table and provide example of low and no selfdisclosure post note that including nonmental health post in the training set wa essential so a to let the detector learn on post of low and no selfdisclosure and on those not mental health related
in this study we gathered information on depression level of twitter user and their activity history to do this we published a website to administer a questionnaire and disseminated information about the website over twitter in contrast to de choudhury et al who collected data from englishspeaking user through crowdsourcing this study collected data from japanesespeaking volunteer this approach wa used to investigate the extent to which depression risk can be estimated for a population different from the population considered by the prior research figure show a screenshot of our website the website collected the response to a questionnaire to evaluate the degree of depression of the twitter user who participated hereinafter the participant and to collect the history of participant activity on twitter the activity history of participant were collected through the twitter application programming interface api and the questionnaire to determine degree of depression were completed by participant through their web browser before data collection visitor to the website were presented with a written explanation of the aim of the experiment the information that would be collected and how that information would be handled those who consented to become participant after receiving the explanation logged into their individual twitter account through the oauth authorization process next participant were surveyed on gender age occupation and history of depression following which they answered a questionnaire designed to evaluate degree of depression a message called the kokoro score kokoro is a japanese word meaning heart determined on the basis of answer to the questionnaire and information in the collected tweet wa displayed to participant after completion of the questionnaire fig experiment participant were able to tweet the message displayed which made it possible to promote the website over twitter by wordofmouth in a type of snowball sampling the cesd questionnaire wa used to evaluate the degree of depression in the cesd test participant answered question on a likerttype point scale each answer wa assigned a score of point with the sum of the point from all answer used a the score to estimate likelihood of depression several standard exist by which to determine the appropriate cutoff score for identifying depression in this research we regarded a score of point or higher a indicating active depression and a score of point or lower a indicating no active depression these are the same value a used in and give a cutoff score of in addition answer to bdi a depression scale used with characteristic similar to cesd were collected to ensure the reliability of data for each participant score were calculated on both scale with poor correlation regarded a indicating unreliable answer the time taken to answer the questionnaire wa also recorded and those completed in too brief a time were excluded after each participant answered the questionnaire the activity history of that participant on twitter wa collected from twitter by using the api at most tweet were collected for each participant and the number of user following the participant and being followed by the participant were recorded tweet published after the questionnaire wa taken were discarded the website wa opened to the public on december at which time the author publicized it on their twitter account between december and february people participated in the experiment after eliminating participant who did not tweet and participant who answered the questionnaire in fewer than second a previously mentioned to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire answer set of answer remained only the first set of answer wa used for participant who completed the questionnaire more than once a a result data about experiment participant male female aged to mean year standard deviation year were analyzed the correlation between cesd score and bdi score for these participant were high and there were no participant with uncorrelated score so the data for all participant were used excluded datasets are not discussed any further figure show the histogram of cesd score of participant among the participant resp were estimated to have resp not have active depression for an incidence of approximately this incidence is similar to that found by de choudhury et al who identified depression in approximately of participant table give statistic on the activity history of participant
this study design raised two important issue regarding ethical research practice a it concerned both individual with mental illness and potentially personally identifiable information we were unable to guarantee strict anonymity to participant given that usernames and personal information posted to twitter are often inherently specific to participant identity such a usernames and tweet containing real name a we potentially had the capacity to link study participant identity to sensitive health information study participant were informed of the risk of being personally identified from their social medium data participant were assured that no personal identifier including usernames would ever be made public or published in any format we used turk prime an interface for conducting mturk study to mask participant mturk worker id from our record we made it clear that any link between social medium data and private personal health data would be available only to our team of researcher and participant were able to request to have their data removed at any time
we used a dataset of nonclinical user who opted into a facebook application mypersonality kosinski and stillwell between june and march completed a item personality questionnaire an international personality item pool ipip proxy to the neopir goldberg and shared access to their status update containing at least word user wrote on average of word total word instance and a subset of user provided gender and age in which were female and the mean age wa the dataset wa divided into training and testing sample in particular the testing sample consisted of a random set of user who wrote at least word and completed the personality measure while the training set contained the remaining user
clinical community community who are interested in depression and with at least post are extracted from livejournal this is identified through the search community by interest provided by livejournal and result in community with post the clinical community are grouped based on name and description of the individual community depression bipolar selfharm attachmentseparation and suicide see table for statistic the earliest community creation date wa in thus our data set span over year b control community we constructed a control data set using five popular category of community in the livejournal directory we select community who have at least post resulting in community with post this set is called control and the statistic of these community and their description are shown in table
a webbased survey of weibo user wa conducted to ass the respondent suicide risk and emotional distress ie depression anxiety and stress the invitation letter to participate in this survey wa widely sent out to general weibo user by various promotion activity for a weibo user to be eligible for the study she or he had to be year or older by selfreport a renminbi incentive for each complete survey wa provided to boost the respond rate with the respondent consent their weibo post that were posted in the public domain during the month before the survey were downloaded by calling weibo api the survey fulfilled the checklist for reporting result of internet esurveys cherry checklist and detail of the procedure have been reported in previous publication in addition when multiple survey feedback were submitted from the same internet protocol address only the first submission wa used to avoid duplicate participation in contrast to a previous study this study excluded those who posted nothing throughout the month but not those who posted fewer than post eventually data provided by respondent remained for further analysis the study ha obtained ethical approval from the human research ethical review committee at the university of hong kong and the institute review board of the institute of psychology at the chinese academy of science the survey measured respondent suicide probability score depression anxiety stress and weibo suicide communication wsc a the outcome variable in addition the respondent weibo post language feature were extracted a independent variable or feature for machine learning the detail of how those data were obtained are elaborated in the following subsection
we first obtained a list of ranked major university in the united state by crawling the u news and world report website this list is constructed based on the carnegie classification employed extensively by higher education researcher and using a set of indicator of academic excellence defined by u news the list includes a variety of university spread across the u in different setting eg urban rural and with a wide range of student enrollment size figure a show their geographic distribution a a part of this crawl we also obtained university metadata gender distribution of student average tuition and fee and academic calendar semesterquarter to obtain further information about the nature of the student body we crawled the wikipedia page of all of the university from these page we extracted the size of student enrollment type publicprivate and setting ruralsuburbanurbancity at every institution these definition come from a formal categorization scheme used by the u department of education the student body enrollment size ranged from to with public and private university university were reported to be urban city suburban and rural finally we obtained information on racial diversity of the university from a website known a priceonomics the website calculates the herfindahlhirschman index hhi by combining the raceethnicity distribution of student body at different university with data given from the department of education hhi range from the least diverse a population of all one type to n the most diverse where n is the number of different racial category being analyzed social medium data of university next we obtained social medium data of the above university specifically we focused on the social medium reddit why reddit reddit is known to be a widely used online forum and social medium site among the college student demographic due to it forum structure it is extensively used for both content sharing a well a for obtaining feedback and information from community of interest reddit harbor a variety of community known a subreddits including many dedicated to specific university campus this allows a large sample of post shared by student of a university to be collected in one place our preliminary manual inspection of university subreddits eg rgatech or rkstate revealed that these subreddits are appropriated by student to discus college topic table focusing on these public reddit community also doe not require explicit data collection effort to be coordinated at each of the university site although more student are likely to use facebook due to it largely privately shared content it is challenging to obtain access to a large dataset of a university student next while twitter is also widely adopted without explicit selfreported information it is challenging to identify college student account finally prior work note that semianonymity of reddit enables candid self disclosure around stigmatized topic like mental health initial data acquisition we leveraged the archive of all of reddit data made available on google bigquery bigquery is a cloud based managed data warehouse that allows third party to access large publicly available dataset through simple sqltype query our query grabbed all post ranging between june and february available in the reddit data archive this included post from unique user across all of the university with a mean of post and unique user per subreddit filling the gap in subreddit data the second step of our data collection process focused on identifying subreddits with insufficient data and supplementing them through additional alternative data collection through reddits official api httpswwwredditcomdevapi we obtained the most recent number of subscriber in the university subreddits a of july then to investigate if and to what extent some subreddits may have had unusually low data a given in step we determined the median unique user to subscriber ratio in each subreddit this allows u to capture the subreddits where the subscriber count is high however the data obtained is not sufficiently representative for subreddits with unique user to subscriber ratio under median in all we performed a onetime data collection using the reddit api this gave u a set of at most most recent post for each subreddit with a total of post added to the data obtained in step following deduplication we note that this procedure did not skew the yearly distribution of data across the subreddits the skew yearly rate of change before and after data filling were and respectively which were found to be statistically equivalent based on a twosample equivalence test p p a test that us two onesided ttests on the beforeafter yearly rate of change from both side of a chosen difference interval
to train our model we require information from two different type of user patient and nonpatients therefore we employed a combined manual effort and keyword matching data collection approach to efficiently collect data for these user for the collection of patient we manually collect the community portal relevant to both mental disorder from these portal follower list we select the selfreported user who explicitly state in their profile description that they suffer from a mental illness ie for a given user we are checking if hisher profile contains any keyword related to a target disorder eg borderline bpd bipolar nonpatients are referred to a random active twitter user who are not explicitly stating that they are suffering from bipolar disorder hereinafter referred to a bd or borderline personality disorder hereinafter referred to a bpd to obtain these user we randomly sampled twitter id thereafter we proceeded to download the tweet from the selected id after the user have been identified we manually label them into one of two category patient a person who is suffering from a mental disorder notrelated any user who we dont consider to be a patient lastly after having obtained the final list of patient we retrieve their tweet these step are applied for the collection of both bpd and bd patient datasets

the majority of social medium analysis approach try to extract signal from individual post and thus do not need to record any personal information however a we start moving towards userlevel analysis we are collecting and storing complete record of social medium user communication even though this information is publicly available people might not be consciously aware of the implication of sharing all their data and certainly have not given explicit consent for their data to be analyzed in aggregate this is even more pertinent for analysis involving sensitive information eg health related issue a it ha been demonstrated by the recent incident involving company inadvertently sharing or failing to protect user personal data there is a serious danger of abuse and exploitation for system that collect and store large amount of personal data even though this is in large part an ethical question there are technical solution that can be used to partially address this issue one is to use anonymization technique to obfuscate any detail that allow third party even analyst to identify the individual that are involved in the study another is to store only abstract representation which can still be updated and consumed by predictive model and discard the actual content in regard to consent there are initiative to support voluntary data donation for research purpose eg the our data help program
we analyze two datasets user community on reddit and journal from a mental health journalling mobile app we omit the name of the app for privacy and we refer to it a the journalling app reddit is a social medium platform that wa originally used for sharing and rating content such a news documentary and music user post in and subscribe to selforganized community known a subreddits subscribing to a subreddit allows a user to view all post from that subreddit an advantage of analyzing reddit data is that the subreddits are labelled according to their topic utilizing curated list from volunteer reddit user we crawled all subreddits related to mental health a well a all subreddits linked by these community the second dataset consists of anonymized journal post from a mobile app designed to help people track their mood and share them anonymously if they desire for each journal post the app requires the user to label the journal post with at least one mood selected from a prepopulated list including happy sad etc we obtained all journal and the associated mood written between january and january this amount to over million journal written by approximately user figure plot the number of journal posted over time most of the journal were written in the first half of although we inspected topic distribution per month and did not find seasonal effect towards the beginning of many new user registered on the app and eventually stopped using it like weightloss and productivity apps we believe this influx is tied to user looking to improve their habit a a new year resolution each journal can be set to be private or public visible to all other user of the app roughly one third of all journal are public figure plot the number of user on the yaxis versus the percentage of journal they posted publicly most user are either mostly private or mostly public most journal are relatively short just like twitter post that are at most character the average length of a journal with text in it is character there are roughly journal that have no text only a mood label we observed that private user tend to write journal that are slightly but statistically significantly longer than those written by public user by approximately character figure show the distribution of journal length where the spike correspond to length mood only character the default limit set by the app and character set a the maximum for visualization purpose user of the app can optionally enter their location age and gender while most user did not enter this information we found that those who revealed their location are mostly from north america those who revealed their gender are predominantly female and those who revealed their age have an average age of
we focus on the social medium platform twitter a popular microblogging service used by of u internet user and whose popularity continues to increase twitter is particularly interesting to study since nearly all post are public the public nature of tweet provides an interesting counterpoint to the private nature of search engine activity we gathered a month sample of twitter firehose stream which includes all public tweet between november and march made available to u under contract focusing on englishlanguage tweet twitter post count and unique user count were computed for each condition and aggregated over the full time period specifically we considered a post to belong to a certain health condition if there wa a regular expression match of the condition to the text of the post this would not permit substring match within term to reduce noise we excluded post that were retweets or contained hyperlink since they were likely related to general news and not a user personal health using this method we obtained tweet on the health condition from user in the time period of interest the median number of post wa per condition from a median of user per condition
reddit is a social news website where registered user submit content in the form of link or text post user also known a redditors can then vote each submission up or down to rank the post and determine it position or prominence on the site page these two attribute associated with a post are referred to a upvotes and downvotes redditors can also comment on post and respond back in a conversation tree of comment content entry that is the post are organized by area of interest or subcommunities called subreddits such a politics programming or science a of reddits official statistic included billion page view million unique visitor post and comment httpblogredditcom toppostsofstatsandsnooyearshtml we used of reddits official api httpwwwredditcom dev api to collect post comment and associated metadata from several mental health subreddits specifically using a python wrapper praw httpsprawreadthedocsorgen latestindexhtml the subreddits we crawled were alcoholism anxiety bipolarreddit depression mentalhealth mmfb make me feel better socialanxiety suicidewatch all of these subreddits host public content in order to arrive at a comprehensive list of subreddits to focus on we utilized reddits native subreddit search feature httpwwwredditcomreddits and searched for subreddits on mental health two researcher familiar with reddit employed an initial filtering step on the search result returned so that we focus on high precision subreddits discussing mental health concern and issue thereafter we focused on a snowball approach in which starting with a few seed subreddits mentalhealth depression we compiled a second list of related or similar subreddits that are listed in the profile page of the seed subreddits following a second filtering step we arrived at the list of subreddits listed above for each of these subreddits we obtained daily crawl of their post in the new category corresponding to each post we collected information on the title of the post the body or textual content id timestamp when the post wa made author id and the number of upvotes and downvotes it obtained since post gather comment over a period of time following the time of sharing we crawled all of the comment per post that were shared over a three day period after the post wa made qualitative examination of the subreddits of interest revealed that or more of the comment to any post were typically made in a three day window following the time the post is madehence the choice the crawl of the subreddits used in this paper we present some descriptive statistic of our crawled data our dataset contained post with at least one comment and comment in all with unique user who made post comment or both a set of user were found to write both at least one post and comment cdf of the user distribution over post and comment is given in figure the figure show the expected heavy tail trend observed in several social phenomenon also see figure for the distribution of comment over time following post share it illustrates the quick responsivity culture in the community we study peak at hour some of the additional statistic of our dataset are given in table further example title of a few
we utilized instagrams official api to obtain the dataset used in this paper each post in this dataset is public and contains postrelated information such a the image caption like comment hashtags filter and geolocation if tagged referring to prior literature we adopted an iterative approach to first identify a set of appropriate distinguishing hashtags around different prominent mental illness prevalent in social medium with the seed tag we performed an initial data collection of million post shared on instagram between dec and nov then by leveraging an association rule mining approach we compiled the top k k frequency cooccurring tag in the m post and then appended them to the original seed tag list for further data collection table list a sample set of tag used to crawl the dataset this final list of tag wa thereafter passed on to a psychiatry researcher to be categorized into different disorder type for tag that described experience or symptom crosscutting across different condition eg anxiety they were counted toward each disorder type table give a list of the ten different disorder identified in our data we additionally consulted the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental health disorder dsmv that indicates these disorder to be prominent mental health challenge in population this categorization of the mental health challenge wa conducted to ensure that our data used in the ensuing analysis focused on wellvalidated and clinically recognized condition at the same time it allowed u to focus on a diverse range of disorder expressed on social medium rather than specific one studied in prior work thus enabling u to discover generalized pattern in visual disclosure of mental health challenge in social medium our final crawl included post from user spanning these disorder
tweet about depression were collected by simply measured a company that specializes in social medium measurement and analytics simply measured simply measured ha access to the twitter firehose or full volume of tweet via gnip a licensed company that can retrieve the full twitter data stream all tweet in the english language that contained at least either depressed depressed depression or depression were collected between april and may we scanned a random sample of the tweet to identify common phrase that included our keywords of interest but were not about mental health in sa version sa institute inc cary nc we used the index function which search a character expression in this case the text of the tweet for a specific string of character to locate and remove such tweet from our sample we removed tweet that included the following term regardless of capitalization great depression economic depression during the depression depression era tropical depression and depressed real estate the popularity and influence of the tweeter wa described using the distribution of follower and klout score while number of follower is a measure of popularity klout score is a measure of influence klout score range from to with a higher score indicating higher influence klout score is calculated based on an algorithm that considers over signal from eight different online network example of signal include the amount of retweets a person generates in relation to the amount of tweet shared and the amount of engagement a user drive from unique individual eg lot of retweets from different individual a opposed to lot of retweets from one person klout inc
we follow the data acquisition and curation process of coppersmith et al a summarizing the major point here social medium such a twitter contains frequent public statement by user reporting diagnosis for various medical condition many talk about physical health condition eg cancer flu but some also discus mental illness including schizophrenia there are a variety of motivation for user to share this information on social medium to offer or seek support to fight the stigma of mental illness or perhaps to offer an explanation for certain behavior we obtain message with these selfreported diagnosis using the twitter api and filtered via caseinsensitive regular expression to require schizo or a close phonetic approximation to be present our expression matched schizophrenia it subtypes and various approximation schizo skitzo skitso schizotypal schizoid etc all data we collect are public post made between and and exclude any message marked a private by the author all use of the data reported in this paper ha been approved by the appropriate institutional review board irb each selfstated diagnosis included in this study wa examined by a human annotator one of the author to verify that it appeared to be a genuine statement of a schizophrenia diagnosis excluding joke quote or disingenuous statement we obtained user with an apparently genuine selfstated diagnosis of a schizophreniarelated condition note that we cannot be certain that the twitter user wa actually diagnosed with schizophrenia only that their statement of being diagnosed appears to be genuine previous work indicates that interannotator agreement for this task is good coppersmith et al a for each user we obtained a set of their public twitter post via the twitter api collecting up to tweet a we wish to focus on userauthored content we exclude from analysis all retweets and any tweet that contain a url which often contain text that the user did not author we lowercase all word and convert any nonstandard character including emoji to a systematic ascii representation via unidecode for our community control we used randomlyselected twitter user who primarily tweet in english specifically during a two week period in early each twitter user who wa included in twitter spritzer sample had an equal chance for inclusion in our pool of community control we then collected some of their historic tweet and assessed the language they tweeted in according to the chromium compact language detector user were excluded from our community control if their tweet were le than englishwords in context often provide more meaning than the word in isolation so we use method for grouping together word that occur in similar linguistic construction brown clustering is a greedy hierarchical algorithm that find a clustering of word that maximizes the mutual information between adjacent cluster in other word word that are preceded by similar word are grouped together to form cluster and then these cluster are merged based on having similar preceding word and then these cluster are further merged etc each word is therefore associated to cluster of increasing granularity we define all leaf cluster a feature and the feature value of each for a user is the proportion of word from the user in that cluster the brown clustering implementation we use is currently available on github and is used with default parameter setting including a limit of cluster httpsgithubcompercyliangbrowncluster
a mentioned earlier we examine data from reddit we provide a description of the feature of this social medium platform which are important to understand the context of our research problem reddit allows user to submit content in the form of link or text post organized by area of interest or subcommunities called subreddits eg politics programming science user can voice their opinion on the post via a voting mechanism which allows more popular submission to be featured more prominently according to their score the difference between the upvotes and downvotes cast on each post also known a score user can also engage with each other via a comment thread attached to each post in reddit had billion page view over active community million post and million comment in this paper we focus specifically on the subreddit called suicidewatch a forum for user contemplating suicide and who seek help advice and support it is a strong support community with currently about k subscriber the community is highly moderated with many of it moderator and active subscriber adopting prominent role in providing support to individual showing vulnerability in this subreddit vote on post are used a a proxy for support and to increase or decrease a post prominence rather than a a statement of agreementdisagreement we used reddits official api to collect post comment and associated metadata from rsuicidewatch hereafter sw our analysis in this paper is based on all post made to sw between october and december post from unique user example paraphrased title of post from rsuicidewatch are given in table we collected the title of the post the body or textual content id timestamp author id the number of upvotes and downvotes the post obtained including the difference between upvotes and downvotes on the post ie score
we briefly explain the data collection method here but we refer the interested reader with further question on the methodology to coppersmith et al for the suicide attempt data and coppersmith et al a for all other condition the data for these analysis are twitter post collected via two method most of the data come from user who have publicly discussed their mental health condition these user are frequently referred to a selfstated diagnosis user a they state publicly something like i wa diagnosed with schizophrenia or im so thankful to have survived my suicide attempt last year the data for user with a suicide attempt wa supplemented by data from ourdatahelpsorg a data donation site where people provide access to their public post and fill out a short questionnaire about their mental health history data are then deidentified and made available to researcher addressing question of interest to the mental health community donor provide consent for their data to be used in mental health research upon signup of the user who attempted suicide came from ourdatahelpsorg specifically we examine generalized anxiety disorder eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia and attempted suicide these condition were selected based on the theory that there are important timing aspect to their symptom ebbing and flowing of symptom a treatment is effective especially schizophrenia onset and exacerbation of symptom by external event and stress and punctuated event in time of psychological symptom suicide attempt panic attack and bingingpurging behavior with eating disorder we use the twitter streaming api to collect a sample of user who used a series of mental health word or phrase in their tweet text eg schizophrenia or suicide attempt each tweet that us one of these phrase is examined via regular expression to indicate that the user is talking about themselves finally those tweet that pas the regular expression are examined by a human to confirm to the best of our ability that their selfstatement of diagnosis appears to be genuine this result in a dataset with user that have a selfstated diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder n an eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia or someone who would go on to attempt suicide some of these user do not exhibit the sort of posting behavior required to create micropatterns ie they rarely post multiple time within a hour time window we exclude these user from our analysis which is of user for most condition with the exception of those with a suicide attempt where a little over half the user do not exhibit this posting behavior the resultant dataset used for analysis is generalized anxiety disorder n eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia suicide attempt in order to allow comparison of each condition to control user we gather a random sample of twitter user for whom at least of their post are identified by twitter a english all the user with a selfstated diagnosis and all member of this control population have their age and gender estimated according to sap et al for each user with a selfstated diagnosis we find a matched control through the following procedure create a pool of user where the estimated gender match and the estimated age is within the same year bracket the suggested accuracy of the age estimator from that pool of age and gender matched user we select the user whose tweet start and end over the most similar timeframe we will refer to these age gender and timematched control simply a matched control throughout the rest of this paper all tweet were publicly posted by their author ie no user marked at protected or private were included on average user had tweet the distribution of estimated age and gender for user with each selfstated condition can be seen in figure for most condition the population skews female though for schizophrenia the gender are roughly balanced the average age tends to be in the earlytomid s
our study us publicly shared mental illness selfdisclosure data collected from the social medium twitter we started by obtaining a large sample of english language candidate selfdisclosure post from the full archive of public twitter data around a variety of mental health concern specifically we filtered the twitter post shared in march containing any of the keyphrases included in table these keyphrases were collated by a combination of reference to prior work and consultation with a trained psychiatrist practitioner through these keyphrases we sought to identify who publicly state that they have been diagnosed with or suffering from some form of mental illness a noted by coppersmith et al user may make such a statement to seek support from others in their twitter social network to fight the stigma of mental illness or perhaps a an explanation of some of their behavior we obtained post from unique user at the end of this initial data collection phase parallelly we obtained a candidate control data sample from twitter firehose stream so a to allow robust statistical comparison between twitter user who choose to selfdisclose their mental illness and those who do not this dataset included a random sample of post from unique user made on twitter during march ensuring that none of these post matched any of the keyphrases given in table thereafter for both of the candidate mental health disclosure sample and the candidate control sample of post we utilized twitter official api to obtain the last post for each of the unique user in both datasets for the control dataset if any of the user had any post in their crawled post matching one of the keyphrases above we disregard them from our analysis further employing the google compact language detector we disregarded any user if at least of their post were not written in english our final candidate disclosure sample contained post from user while the control sample contained post from user
a comparison of the datasets wa performed to determine the existence of differential linguistic and behavioral feature the different feature that were analyzed are shown in table the textual content of each tweet wa analyzed by mean of the following sequence of step tokenization performed by mean of a custom twitter tokenizer included in the natural language toolkit partofspeech po tagging performed by mean of the freeling natural language processing tool in order to analyse the usage pattern of grammatical category eg adjective noun or pronoun in the text of tweet identification of negation performed by relying on a custom list of spanish negation expression such a nada nothing nadie nobody no no nunca never and alike identification of occurrence of positive and negative word inside the text of each tweet by mean of spanish polarity lexicon the spanish sentiment lexicon and the spanish senticon lexicon we exploited lexicon to consider and compare approach of modeling polarity in spanish text thus reducing any language modeling bias that the use of a single language resource could introduce identification of word and expression associated to the basic emotion by using the spanish emotion lexicon such emotion are alegra happiness enojo anger miedo fear repulsin disgust sorpresa surprise and tristeza sadness all the tool and aforementioned resource are publicly available the statistical analysis were carried out with the r version r development core team and spss statistic version ibm applying the relevant test for each type of comparison to be carried outthe selection of the tweet and their user wa based on the filtered realtime streaming support provided by the twitter api in the first step we selected the user who showed potential sign of depression on twitter on the basis of the most frequent word in spanish expressed by patient suffering from depression in clinical setting these word were jointly identified and selected by a psychologist and a family physician with clinical experience and were based on the definition and general feature of depression according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder the list of word used and their english translation are shown in textbox during june tweet including or more occurrence of the word listed in textbox were collected from this collection of tweet and to select the user who publicly stated in the textual description associated to their profile that they suffered from depression all the profile description including or more occurrence of the word depr and all the possible derivation related to the word depression in spanish such a depre depresin depresivo depresiva deprimido and deprimida were considered from the user who included or more of these word in their description profile user who stated they suffered from depression or were receiving treatment for depression were selected for the analysis this selection wa performed by a psychologist verifying that the statement were related to real expression of depression excluding quote joke or fake one for each of these depressed twitter user we collected all the most recent tweet from their timeline up to a maximum of about tweet thus a total of tweet were collected a figure that wa reduced to after discarding the retweets these tweet constituted the depressive user dataset example of sentence appearing in the user profile that were used for selecting the depressive user are paciente psiquitrico con depresin crnica psychiatric patient with chronic depression example of a profile sentence that indicates depression colecciono errores traducidos a tweet depresivos y a uno que otro impulso de amor i gather error translated into depressing tweet and into one or another love impulse example of a profile sentence that doe not indicate depression once the user with profile sentence indicating depression had been retrieved their twitter timeline were collected only
