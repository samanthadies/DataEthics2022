https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359169,0,selection criterion and data scope to understand the impact of cultural difference on how individual use online mental health platform we begin our analysis by creating a dataset of user from different national community on talklife a support platform with over half a million user for this analysis due to the fact that most research in cscw on mental health online ha been done either agnostic of cultural context or in a western context we choose to focus on user from nonwestern country following zhang et al a researcher located in the global south and with lived experience interacting with the health system and diverse explanatory model of mental illness we believe that moving the focus of cscw and cscwadjacent mental health research away from the west is crucial to better meet the need of people often underserved by the medical system to create these subgroup of user we choose the three nonwestern country with the highest user population on talklife or india malaysia and the philippine guided by the rich amount of literature on the unique nuance to mental health expression for each country we examine the national identity linguistic and behaviorbased difference of use between each user subgroup in particular this research note that a a result of cultural norm around the sharing of distress and alternative conceptualization of mental illness in india malaysia and the philippine symptom are often expressed in somatic and religious term a opposed to traditionally clinical or psychiatric term we choose to analyze each subgroup at the national level for both theoretical and practical reason on a theoretical level in past work in the medical anthropology of mental health national identity ha commonly been used for a approximate level of analysis for cultural identity additionally on a more practical level each user country wa determined using their ip address by talklife and shared with u in an useranonymized dataset inferring a more precise location could potentially compromise user anonymity a discussed in past work and did not seem to have any more significant value for our analysis of cultural difference than analysis at the national level we analyze data from indian user malaysian user and filipino user a shown in table collectively we refer to these country a the minority sample a a comparison set we construct a random sample of all thread on talklife and refer to it a the majority sample due to the relative prevalence of user from western englishspeaking country in talklife most of the thread in the majority sample include post from country such a the usa uk and canada indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on talklife data wa sampled from may to june following this crossnational analysis to see if our broader result on talklife generalize to a differently structured online mental health community we picked the largest western country the united state and the largest nonwestern country india represented on cup a similar support platform with more than user actively using the platform each week using cup data we repeat our analysis testing for the same cultural difference we found in our talklife sample for this analysis we were provided a sample of data on activity from indian user and american user a shown in table unlike our sample of talklife user this dataset is not a random sample there is an upsampling of indian user to ensure that we have data from a sufficient number of indian in the dataset like on talklife indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on cup we focus on indian user due to a lack of sufficient data on user from malaysia or the philippine data wa sampled from march august defining cultural identity and use of clinical language in this work we examine the relationship between cultural identity and use of online mental health support forum to do so we leverage tomlinsons definition of cultural identity a self and communal definition based around specific usually politically inflected differentiation gender sexuality class religion race and ethnicity nationality particularly looking at the aspect that of modern cultural identity that run along national line a delineated by hall et al a a diverse and amorphous form of identity cultural identity can often intersect and interact with other form of identity including religious or ethnic identity however in the absence of direct information about religious or ethnic identity based on the data available we use national identity a a proxy for cultural identity additionally following schlesinger et al call for more intersectional analysis and method within hci we also include analysis of adjacent and intersecting identity when relevant including religious identity to analyze clinical language we use a broader definition of clinical language than just specific medical diagnosis following method used in past work to analyze antidepressant related language we create a dataset of clinical mental health language including unigrams bigram and trigram from a list of mental disorder a defined by the international classification of disease icd and diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder dsm we also included all unigrams from the macmillan dictionary list of word used to describe illness and disease both specifically for mental illness and general illness a a result we include unigrams like night from night terror or sleep from sleep disorder a these are often correlated with specific symptom of mental illness or distress such a sleep issue or being awake at night this included any clinically common abbreviation for mental disorder such a ocd for obsessive compulsive disorder or bpd for borderline personality disorder shorthand for disorder commonly used by online community such a proana a used in proeating disorder community were not included due to the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of these term across disorder we choose to use term from and associated with dsm and icd categorized disorder a a result of the common usage of these framework globally throughout our analysis of these varied factor we use to represent mean and to represent standard deviation constraint limitation and tradeoff cultural identity can exist at many different and intersecting level including subculture and subcommunities within the larger umbrella of a cultural identity a a result for the purpose of this analysis we had to adopt some constraint in order to do a meaningful and specific analysis one large limiting constraint that we chose for this study is to use national identity at the state level a a proxy for cultural identity though a major and formative part of modern cultural identity a argued by both hall and tomlinson each country we analyze is incredibly diverse with many individual cultural identity that both intersect and diverge from a greater national identity a more rich analysis of these other form of cultural identity is beyond the scope of this work but could lead to richer conclusion about the nature of cultural identity in online mental health support community particularly with regard to cultural difference between user with the same national identity additionally to stay consistent between analysis a a result of a lack of data on user from malaysia and the philippine we only analyze user in india on cup and extend these finding to the experience of being part of a minority group on an online mental health forum we draw validity for these exploratory finding from similar consistent pattern we observe between indian malaysian and filipino user but a deeper analysis with a larger dataset is likely necessary to determine when and for which minority community these conclusion do not hold true additionally while we construct clinical language through use of the commonly used dsm and icd both framework of illness categorization have significant limitation particularly in the country we have selected for example there are both mental health disorder that are culturebound a well a mental health language that is used in different way within the specific country we analyze such a depression often being an umbrella term for all mental illness additionally it is clear that online support community often develop their own cultural norm and language around mental health and a deeper understanding of how this play out on talklife and cup is neither the focus nor within the scope of this work in this work we intentionally use standard clinical and medical term for mental health disorder in our analysis of clinical language a detailed in past anthropological research it is theorized that the use of medical and clinical language is representative of a medicalized explanatory model of illness and we frame use of this language across culture a a approximate signifier of a greater awareness of the presence of a mental disorder a opposed to conceptualizing distress a stress tension or depression for our analysis we strictly analyzed post that were in the latin alphabet with almost all post on both talklife and cup being in english however a both malay and tagalog are most commonly written in the latin script and since it is common for user from india speaker to use romanized version of indian language online it is possible that a small minority of post in our analysis were text in a different language however a confirmed by only seeing english word used in our analysis of the top ngrams among each user subgroup it is clear that english is the predominant language on both platform though beyond the immediate scope of this work a greater analysis of nonenglish codeswitching on these platform could lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of interaction on expression between user with the same national identity but different language preference
