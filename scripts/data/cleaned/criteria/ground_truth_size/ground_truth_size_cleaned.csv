https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025909,1,we first obtained a list of ranked major university in the united state by crawling the u news and world report website this list is constructed based on the carnegie classification employed extensively by higher education researcher and using a set of indicator of academic excellence defined by u news the list includes a variety of university spread across the u in different setting eg urban rural and with a wide range of student enrollment size figure a show their geographic distribution a a part of this crawl we also obtained university metadata gender distribution of student average tuition and fee and academic calendar semesterquarter to obtain further information about the nature of the student body we crawled the wikipedia page of all of the university from these page we extracted the size of student enrollment type publicprivate and setting ruralsuburbanurbancity at every institution these definition come from a formal categorization scheme used by the u department of education the student body enrollment size ranged from to with public and private university university were reported to be urban city suburban and rural finally we obtained information on racial diversity of the university from a website known a priceonomics the website calculates the herfindahlhirschman index hhi by combining the raceethnicity distribution of student body at different university with data given from the department of education hhi range from the least diverse a population of all one type to n the most diverse where n is the number of different racial category being analyzed social medium data of university next we obtained social medium data of the above university specifically we focused on the social medium reddit why reddit reddit is known to be a widely used online forum and social medium site among the college student demographic due to it forum structure it is extensively used for both content sharing a well a for obtaining feedback and information from community of interest reddit harbor a variety of community known a subreddits including many dedicated to specific university campus this allows a large sample of post shared by student of a university to be collected in one place our preliminary manual inspection of university subreddits eg rgatech or rkstate revealed that these subreddits are appropriated by student to discus college topic table focusing on these public reddit community also doe not require explicit data collection effort to be coordinated at each of the university site although more student are likely to use facebook due to it largely privately shared content it is challenging to obtain access to a large dataset of a university student next while twitter is also widely adopted without explicit selfreported information it is challenging to identify college student account finally prior work note that semianonymity of reddit enables candid self disclosure around stigmatized topic like mental health initial data acquisition we leveraged the archive of all of reddit data made available on google bigquery bigquery is a cloud based managed data warehouse that allows third party to access large publicly available dataset through simple sqltype query our query grabbed all post ranging between june and february available in the reddit data archive this included post from unique user across all of the university with a mean of post and unique user per subreddit filling the gap in subreddit data the second step of our data collection process focused on identifying subreddits with insufficient data and supplementing them through additional alternative data collection through reddits official api httpswwwredditcomdevapi we obtained the most recent number of subscriber in the university subreddits a of july then to investigate if and to what extent some subreddits may have had unusually low data a given in step we determined the median unique user to subscriber ratio in each subreddit this allows u to capture the subreddits where the subscriber count is high however the data obtained is not sufficiently representative for subreddits with unique user to subscriber ratio under median in all we performed a onetime data collection using the reddit api this gave u a set of at most most recent post for each subreddit with a total of post added to the data obtained in step following deduplication we note that this procedure did not skew the yearly distribution of data across the subreddits the skew yearly rate of change before and after data filling were and respectively which were found to be statistically equivalent based on a twosample equivalence test p p a test that us two onesided ttests on the beforeafter yearly rate of change from both side of a chosen difference interval based on the reddit data we collected from figure b we observe high positive correlation between a university size of student body enrollment and the number of user subscribing to the corresponding subreddit r p for subreddits deviating from trend it would imply that the associated university student body wa under or overrepresented on reddit we therefore devised a method to identify these subreddits to correct especially for underadoption bias we first calculated the ratio between the number of subreddit subscriber to student enrollment for each subreddit and the corresponding university if for a subreddit this ratio wa le than the expected adoption of reddit for the same demographic group a of we assumed that reddit wa underadopted by the student in the corresponding university we thus removed subreddits where this ratio wa this brought down our subreddits from to in these subreddits the mean reddit adoption wa which is close to the highest adoption reported by pew the final dataset employed in our ensuing analysis included post from unique user mean post per subreddit mean user per subreddit figure a give a distribution of the volume of crawled post over the year figure b give the final distribution of subreddits over the unique user to subscriber count ratio figure cd give distribution of the post and unique user across the final subreddits

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68764-y,1,the data preprocessing procedure for the collected post data is presented in fig after collecting the data each title wa combined with it corresponding post we removed unnecessary punctuation mark and white space for each post then we used the natural language toolkit nltk implemented in python to tokenize user post and filter frequently employed word stop word porter stemmer a tool used to define a series of guideline for exploring word meaning and source wa employed on the tokenized word to convert a word to it root meaning and to decrease the number of word corpus after this procedure data from user with post in total were employed for the analysis
https://aclanthology.org/W19-3013.pdf,1,we constructed a cohort for our analysis by randomly selecting a sample of twitter user and processing it with the aforementioned demographic inference pipeline after discarding account from user located outside the united state we obtained a cohort of k twitter user with the demographic composition shown in figure some demographic group are overrepresented eg young adult while others are grossly underrepresented eg teenager which illustrates the need for methodology that can take these disparity into account we then processed the cohort through the mentalhealth classifier to estimate the prevalence of depression and ptsd and examine how these illness manifest across the population the analysis revealed that of the cohort member are likely to suffer from depression from ptsd and from both we observe a significant overlap between people affected by depression and ptsd which is not surprising given that the comorbidity of these disorder is wellknown with approximately half of people with ptsd also having a diagnosis of major depressive disorder flory and yehuda how do these condition affect different part of the population to answer this question we looked at the affected user and measured how the demographic of individual subpopulation differ from those of the cohort a a whole figure and show the estimate for depression ptsd and both controlled for the cohort demographic we observe large generational difference ptsd seems to be more prevalent among older people whereas depression affect predominantly younger people we also observe that in all case woman are more susceptible than men and black and hispanic are more likely to be affected than white this may represent a bias in the underlying data used to construct the classifier or a difference in how social medium is used by different demographic group for example model that were trained with a majority of data from white user maybe oversensitive to specific dialect used by other community

https://aclanthology.org/W17-3110.pdf,1,we briefly explain the data collection method here but we refer the interested reader with further question on the methodology to coppersmith et al for the suicide attempt data and coppersmith et al a for all other condition the data for these analysis are twitter post collected via two method most of the data come from user who have publicly discussed their mental health condition these user are frequently referred to a selfstated diagnosis user a they state publicly something like i wa diagnosed with schizophrenia or im so thankful to have survived my suicide attempt last year the data for user with a suicide attempt wa supplemented by data from ourdatahelpsorg a data donation site where people provide access to their public post and fill out a short questionnaire about their mental health history data are then deidentified and made available to researcher addressing question of interest to the mental health community donor provide consent for their data to be used in mental health research upon signup of the user who attempted suicide came from ourdatahelpsorg specifically we examine generalized anxiety disorder eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia and attempted suicide these condition were selected based on the theory that there are important timing aspect to their symptom ebbing and flowing of symptom a treatment is effective especially schizophrenia onset and exacerbation of symptom by external event and stress and punctuated event in time of psychological symptom suicide attempt panic attack and bingingpurging behavior with eating disorder we use the twitter streaming api to collect a sample of user who used a series of mental health word or phrase in their tweet text eg schizophrenia or suicide attempt each tweet that us one of these phrase is examined via regular expression to indicate that the user is talking about themselves finally those tweet that pas the regular expression are examined by a human to confirm to the best of our ability that their selfstatement of diagnosis appears to be genuine this result in a dataset with user that have a selfstated diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder n an eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia or someone who would go on to attempt suicide some of these user do not exhibit the sort of posting behavior required to create micropatterns ie they rarely post multiple time within a hour time window we exclude these user from our analysis which is of user for most condition with the exception of those with a suicide attempt where a little over half the user do not exhibit this posting behavior the resultant dataset used for analysis is generalized anxiety disorder n eating disorder panic attack schizophrenia suicide attempt in order to allow comparison of each condition to control user we gather a random sample of twitter user for whom at least of their post are identified by twitter a english all the user with a selfstated diagnosis and all member of this control population have their age and gender estimated according to sap et al for each user with a selfstated diagnosis we find a matched control through the following procedure create a pool of user where the estimated gender match and the estimated age is within the same year bracket the suggested accuracy of the age estimator from that pool of age and gender matched user we select the user whose tweet start and end over the most similar timeframe we will refer to these age gender and timematched control simply a matched control throughout the rest of this paper all tweet were publicly posted by their author ie no user marked at protected or private were included on average user had tweet the distribution of estimated age and gender for user with each selfstated condition can be seen in figure for most condition the population skews female though for schizophrenia the gender are roughly balanced the average age tends to be in the earlytomid s
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2998181.2998220,1,our study us publicly shared mental illness selfdisclosure data collected from the social medium twitter we started by obtaining a large sample of english language candidate selfdisclosure post from the full archive of public twitter data around a variety of mental health concern specifically we filtered the twitter post shared in march containing any of the keyphrases included in table these keyphrases were collated by a combination of reference to prior work and consultation with a trained psychiatrist practitioner through these keyphrases we sought to identify who publicly state that they have been diagnosed with or suffering from some form of mental illness a noted by coppersmith et al user may make such a statement to seek support from others in their twitter social network to fight the stigma of mental illness or perhaps a an explanation of some of their behavior we obtained post from unique user at the end of this initial data collection phase parallelly we obtained a candidate control data sample from twitter firehose stream so a to allow robust statistical comparison between twitter user who choose to selfdisclose their mental illness and those who do not this dataset included a random sample of post from unique user made on twitter during march ensuring that none of these post matched any of the keyphrases given in table thereafter for both of the candidate mental health disclosure sample and the candidate control sample of post we utilized twitter official api to obtain the last post for each of the unique user in both datasets for the control dataset if any of the user had any post in their crawled post matching one of the keyphrases above we disregard them from our analysis further employing the google compact language detector we disregarded any user if at least of their post were not written in english our final candidate disclosure sample contained post from user while the control sample contained post from user finally we validated both our gender and country name inference method based on annotation obtained from two independent raters on a sample of user we found agreement between the raters annotation and the one given by our method for of the case for gender and of the case for country name in our candidate disclosure and candidate control datasets we were able to infer binary gender for candidate mental health of which were female and candidate control user of which were female respectively and country information for and user for the same two group respectively within the scope of this paper we restrict our attention to four most populated country where english is a predominant form of expression western country u uk gb and majority world country india in and south africa za all of these country fare in the country with most population focusing on these country provides u with a lens to examine crosscultural difference in the disclosure of mental illness on social medium
https://www.jmir.org/2019/6/e14199/,1,this study wa designed and developed in step with the aim of analyzing the linguistic pattern and behavioral feature of twitter user suffering from depression in comparison with the general population of twitter user the study wa focused on tweet written in spanish in the first step the selection of user and the compilation of tweet were performed given the design and purpose of the study we decided to use the twitter application programming interface api using this api datasets of tweet were created the depressive user dataset wa made up of the timeline of user who publicly mentioned on their twitter profile that they suffer from depression the control dataset wa made up of the timeline of randomly selected twitter user the depressive tweet dataset wa constituted by a manual selection of tweet from the depressive user dataset which specifically included expression indicative of depression in the second step comparison and analysis of the datasets of tweet control depressive user and depressive tweet datasets were carried out to spot their distinguishing feature in the rest of this section we will describe the methodology in detail the flow diagram of the study is depicted in figure the selection of the tweet and their user wa based on the filtered realtime streaming support provided by the twitter api in the first step we selected the user who showed potential sign of depression on twitter on the basis of the most frequent word in spanish expressed by patient suffering from depression in clinical setting these word were jointly identified and selected by a psychologist and a family physician with clinical experience and were based on the definition and general feature of depression according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder the list of word used and their english translation are shown in textbox during june tweet including or more occurrence of the word listed in textbox were collected from this collection of tweet and to select the user who publicly stated in the textual description associated to their profile that they suffered from depression all the profile description including or more occurrence of the word depr and all the possible derivation related to the word depression in spanish such a depre depresin depresivo depresiva deprimido and deprimida were considered from the user who included or more of these word in their description profile user who stated they suffered from depression or were receiving treatment for depression were selected for the analysis this selection wa performed by a psychologist verifying that the statement were related to real expression of depression excluding quote joke or fake one for each of these depressed twitter user we collected all the most recent tweet from their timeline up to a maximum of about tweet thus a total of tweet were collected a figure that wa reduced to after discarding the retweets these tweet constituted the depressive user dataset example of sentence appearing in the user profile that were used for selecting the depressive user are paciente psiquitrico con depresin crnica psychiatric patient with chronic depression example of a profile sentence that indicates depression colecciono errores traducidos a tweet depresivos y a uno que otro impulso de amor i gather error translated into depressing tweet and into one or another love impulse example of a profile sentence that doe not indicate depression once the user with profile sentence indicating depression had been retrieved their twitter timeline were collected only those user having in their timeline at least tweet that suggested sign of depression were retained for further analysis for each user the selection of these tweet wa performed by manually inspecting the tweet of the user complete timeline in reverse temporal order starting from the most recent one to the oldest tweet of the timeline retrieved by mean of the twitter api finally a total number of tweet issued by the depressive user suggesting sign of depression were detected and used for the analysis this set of tweet provided u with the depressive tweet dataset which wa used to analyze linguistic feature of tweet showing sign of depression it ha to be mentioned that these tweet were not to be included in the depressive user dataset see figure at the same time more than tweet were also collected in june such tweet were gathered by listening to the public twitter stream during this time span by only considering tweet with spanish textual content a detected by twitter language identification support given that twitter requires more restrictive filter than just the language of the tweet we used a list of the most frequently used spanish word stopwords to retrieve all tweet that included or more of these word the vast majority of spanish tweet should match this criterion a sample of user who did not mention in their profile the word depression and it derivation were selected randomly from the tweet the complete timeline of these user were compiled tweet which were reduced to once retweets were removed these tweet constituted the control dataset to identify the language of a tweet we relied on the language automatically identified by twitter for each tweet selecting tweet in spanish it ha to be noted that these data can contain some tweet from unidentified depressive user

https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359169,1,selection criterion and data scope to understand the impact of cultural difference on how individual use online mental health platform we begin our analysis by creating a dataset of user from different national community on talklife a support platform with over half a million user for this analysis due to the fact that most research in cscw on mental health online ha been done either agnostic of cultural context or in a western context we choose to focus on user from nonwestern country following zhang et al a researcher located in the global south and with lived experience interacting with the health system and diverse explanatory model of mental illness we believe that moving the focus of cscw and cscwadjacent mental health research away from the west is crucial to better meet the need of people often underserved by the medical system to create these subgroup of user we choose the three nonwestern country with the highest user population on talklife or india malaysia and the philippine guided by the rich amount of literature on the unique nuance to mental health expression for each country we examine the national identity linguistic and behaviorbased difference of use between each user subgroup in particular this research note that a a result of cultural norm around the sharing of distress and alternative conceptualization of mental illness in india malaysia and the philippine symptom are often expressed in somatic and religious term a opposed to traditionally clinical or psychiatric term we choose to analyze each subgroup at the national level for both theoretical and practical reason on a theoretical level in past work in the medical anthropology of mental health national identity ha commonly been used for a approximate level of analysis for cultural identity additionally on a more practical level each user country wa determined using their ip address by talklife and shared with u in an useranonymized dataset inferring a more precise location could potentially compromise user anonymity a discussed in past work and did not seem to have any more significant value for our analysis of cultural difference than analysis at the national level we analyze data from indian user malaysian user and filipino user a shown in table collectively we refer to these country a the minority sample a a comparison set we construct a random sample of all thread on talklife and refer to it a the majority sample due to the relative prevalence of user from western englishspeaking country in talklife most of the thread in the majority sample include post from country such a the usa uk and canada indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on talklife data wa sampled from may to june following this crossnational analysis to see if our broader result on talklife generalize to a differently structured online mental health community we picked the largest western country the united state and the largest nonwestern country india represented on cup a similar support platform with more than user actively using the platform each week using cup data we repeat our analysis testing for the same cultural difference we found in our talklife sample for this analysis we were provided a sample of data on activity from indian user and american user a shown in table unlike our sample of talklife user this dataset is not a random sample there is an upsampling of indian user to ensure that we have data from a sufficient number of indian in the dataset like on talklife indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on cup we focus on indian user due to a lack of sufficient data on user from malaysia or the philippine data wa sampled from march august defining cultural identity and use of clinical language in this work we examine the relationship between cultural identity and use of online mental health support forum to do so we leverage tomlinsons definition of cultural identity a self and communal definition based around specific usually politically inflected differentiation gender sexuality class religion race and ethnicity nationality particularly looking at the aspect that of modern cultural identity that run along national line a delineated by hall et al a a diverse and amorphous form of identity cultural identity can often intersect and interact with other form of identity including religious or ethnic identity however in the absence of direct information about religious or ethnic identity based on the data available we use national identity a a proxy for cultural identity additionally following schlesinger et al call for more intersectional analysis and method within hci we also include analysis of adjacent and intersecting identity when relevant including religious identity to analyze clinical language we use a broader definition of clinical language than just specific medical diagnosis following method used in past work to analyze antidepressant related language we create a dataset of clinical mental health language including unigrams bigram and trigram from a list of mental disorder a defined by the international classification of disease icd and diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder dsm we also included all unigrams from the macmillan dictionary list of word used to describe illness and disease both specifically for mental illness and general illness a a result we include unigrams like night from night terror or sleep from sleep disorder a these are often correlated with specific symptom of mental illness or distress such a sleep issue or being awake at night this included any clinically common abbreviation for mental disorder such a ocd for obsessive compulsive disorder or bpd for borderline personality disorder shorthand for disorder commonly used by online community such a proana a used in proeating disorder community were not included due to the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of these term across disorder we choose to use term from and associated with dsm and icd categorized disorder a a result of the common usage of these framework globally throughout our analysis of these varied factor we use to represent mean and to represent standard deviation constraint limitation and tradeoff cultural identity can exist at many different and intersecting level including subculture and subcommunities within the larger umbrella of a cultural identity a a result for the purpose of this analysis we had to adopt some constraint in order to do a meaningful and specific analysis one large limiting constraint that we chose for this study is to use national identity at the state level a a proxy for cultural identity though a major and formative part of modern cultural identity a argued by both hall and tomlinson each country we analyze is incredibly diverse with many individual cultural identity that both intersect and diverge from a greater national identity a more rich analysis of these other form of cultural identity is beyond the scope of this work but could lead to richer conclusion about the nature of cultural identity in online mental health support community particularly with regard to cultural difference between user with the same national identity additionally to stay consistent between analysis a a result of a lack of data on user from malaysia and the philippine we only analyze user in india on cup and extend these finding to the experience of being part of a minority group on an online mental health forum we draw validity for these exploratory finding from similar consistent pattern we observe between indian malaysian and filipino user but a deeper analysis with a larger dataset is likely necessary to determine when and for which minority community these conclusion do not hold true additionally while we construct clinical language through use of the commonly used dsm and icd both framework of illness categorization have significant limitation particularly in the country we have selected for example there are both mental health disorder that are culturebound a well a mental health language that is used in different way within the specific country we analyze such a depression often being an umbrella term for all mental illness additionally it is clear that online support community often develop their own cultural norm and language around mental health and a deeper understanding of how this play out on talklife and cup is neither the focus nor within the scope of this work in this work we intentionally use standard clinical and medical term for mental health disorder in our analysis of clinical language a detailed in past anthropological research it is theorized that the use of medical and clinical language is representative of a medicalized explanatory model of illness and we frame use of this language across culture a a approximate signifier of a greater awareness of the presence of a mental disorder a opposed to conceptualizing distress a stress tension or depression for our analysis we strictly analyzed post that were in the latin alphabet with almost all post on both talklife and cup being in english however a both malay and tagalog are most commonly written in the latin script and since it is common for user from india speaker to use romanized version of indian language online it is possible that a small minority of post in our analysis were text in a different language however a confirmed by only seeing english word used in our analysis of the top ngrams among each user subgroup it is clear that english is the predominant language on both platform though beyond the immediate scope of this work a greater analysis of nonenglish codeswitching on these platform could lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of interaction on expression between user with the same national identity but different language preference
